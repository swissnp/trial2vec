This is especially important for medically underserved areas where melanoma outcomes are worse than in areas with greater access to in-person evaluations. If successful, the widespread availability of such services would be combined with public education efforts to encourage individuals with changing skin lesions to seek evaluation. With decreased travel times to high quality diagnostic services, such efforts may decrease the diagnosis of more advanced melanomas (with a concomitant increase in the diagnosis of earlier stage tumors), and potentially decrease melanoma mortality.\\n\\nDetailed Description \\nThis is a prospective pilot study of a store-and-forward telemedicine diagnostic assessment of participant-selected skin lesions concerning for skin cancer, controlled against an in-person dermatologist assessment (gold standard evaluation). The study will be a single arm design with each participant undergoing telemedicine data acquisition (i.e. clinical and dermoscopic imaging and Nevisense measurement), immediately followed by the in-person dermatologist assessment. The in-person dermatologist will be blinded to the Nevisense score at the time of the visit. Using the telemedicine data, the teledermatology team will render a biopsy/no-biopsy recommendation within 3 business days of the participant evaluation. They will be blinded to the results of the in-person dermatologist's diagnostic evaluation.\\n\\n#Intervention \\n- DEVICE : Nevisense 3.0 \\n\\t- Nevisense, an AI-based point-of-care system for the non-invasive evaluation of irregular moles remains the only FDA approved system available for melanoma detection in the US. Nevisense 3.0 will be used as a one-time exposure of \\\\<8 seconds per lesion. Disposable electrodes that contact the participant are 5mm x 5mm in size. Nevisense 3.0 measures electrical impedance of skin lesions and provides an output called the electrical impedence spectroscopy (EIS) score. Electrical impedance is a measure of a material's overall resistance to the flow of alternating electric currents of various frequencies. The principle is that electrical impedance is different in normal versus abnormal tissue.\\n- DEVICE : Dermlite Cam \\n\\t- Dermlite Cam is a digital camera that captures images of the skin under cross-polarized and non-polarized light and is 510(k) exempt. The DermLite Cam device appears as a single piece camera with a charging cable and USB computer cable. As part of the camera unit, an extensor arm exists to allow for the capture of standardized clinical images. The DermLite Cam will be used to acquire 3 images of \\\\<5 seconds per lesion (one clinical, one polarized dermoscopic, and one non-polarized dermoscopic). NOTE - for the purposes of this study, teledermatology images (dermoscopic and clinical - at approximately 6 inches, 12 inches, and 18 inches) were taken using the Barco Demetra after technical issues arose that prohibited the continued use of the Dermlite Cam.\\n- PROCEDURE : Skin biopsy \\n\\t- A skin biopsy is a small procedure that removes a sample of skin from the surface of the body. The method utilized will be either a shave or punch technique. The maximum size of a punch biopsy will be 6mm and these wounds are generally closed with no more than 2-3 sutures. A skin biopsy takes \\\\<15 minutes including preparation time, administration of intradermal anesthesia using lidocaine 1% with epinephrine 1:100,000, removal of the skin sample, achievement of hemostasis, dressing the wound, and providing instructions for home care. Samples will be placed formalin for routine processing.\\n- DEVICE : Barco Demetra \\n\\t- Barco Demetra is a non-invasive skin imaging system, which acquires multispectral and white light dermoscopic images and clinical photographs of the skin which can then be stored, retrieved, displayed, and reviewed by medical practitioners. The Barco Demetra received 510(k) Premarket approval (K192829). The system involves a hardware imaging device and a stand-alone software application. The hardware device is a portable, battery-powered medical device for acquiring and visualizing images of the skin and uploads all images to cloud storage. The software application is cloud software with an associated web application; it can be used to visualize images and related data and can generate consultation reports. For the purposes of this study, teledermatology images (dermoscopic and clinical - at approximately 6 inches, 12 inches, and 18 inches) were taken using the Barco Demetra after technical issues arose that prohibited the continued use of the Dermlite Cam.\", 'criteria': '#Eligibility Criteria:\\nInclusion Criteria:\\n\\n* Be 18 years or older\\n* Have 1 <= age <= 3 lesions for evaluation\\n\\nExclusion Criteria:\\n\\n* Lesions of the hair-bearing scalp, in the mouth, on the lips, genitalia, nails, on/around the eyes, inside the ear\\n\\nSex :\\nALL\\n\\nAges : \\n- Minimum Age : 18 Years\\n- Maximum Age : 90 Years\\n- Age Group (Child: birth-17, Adult: 18-64, Older Adult: 65+) : OLDER_ADULT, ADULT\\n\\nAccepts Healthy Volunteers:\\n Yes\\n', 'NCT_ID': 'NCT04411810', '__index_level_0__': 110788}\n"
