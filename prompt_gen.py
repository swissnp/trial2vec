Task Instructions:
1. Derive a step-by-step deriviation starting from the "Title" and "Description" provided, gradually building up to support the "Desired criteria".
2. Clearly explain the rationale behind each parameter of all criteria, including values, thresholds, and other specific details.
3. Could use example studies (in the <RELATED_STUDIES> section) if they support your justifications, but ensure the reasoning is well-explained and relevant to the study's context.
4. Avoid mentioning that the criteria were already provided, and please do not cite the "Desired criteria" directly in your justification.
5. You should give the justification/deriviation first before giving out any thing about the specific criteria/values/parameters. 
    5.1) 
    - BAD EXAMPLE: The study requires a platelet count of >50,000, which is a reasonable threshold to ensure that patients are not at risk of bleeding complications.
    - GOOD EXAMPLE: AS the study aims to investigate post-thrombotic syndrome, it is important to ensure that patients are not at risk of bleeding complications. As also seen in NCT00216866, A platelet count of >50,000 is a reasonable threshold to ensure this.
    5.2)
    - BAD EXAMPLE: The study requires participants with an ejection fraction of <40%, as this ensures reliable outcomes in the population of interest.
    - GOOD EXAMPLE: To evaluate the efficacy of the intervention on heart failure, it is essential to ensure that participants have significant but stable cardiac impairment. This prevents confounding by acute conditions and ensures reliable outcomes. Studies like NCT03536880 set an ejection fraction threshold of <40% for this reason, reflecting patients with systolic dysfunction while avoiding excessively low values that could result in high mortality unrelated to the intervention.
