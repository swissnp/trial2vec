    "## Chain of Thought (CoT) Creation\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we aim to create a Chain of Thought (CoT) for clinical trial studies using HuggingFace's transformers and other relevant libraries. Below is a step-by-step guide to our workflow:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Setup and Initialization**:\n",
    "  - We initialize the ChromaDB client and load the SentenceTransformer model for encoding queries.\n",
    "  - We define a function to fix invalid JSON strings, which is crucial for handling the metadata of clinical trial studies.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Retrieving Relevant Studies**:\n",
    "  - We define a function `retrieve_relevant_studies` that queries the ChromaDB collection to find studies relevant to a given query, excluding the study already present in the query.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Crafting Context from Studies**:\n",
    "  - We define a function `craft_context_from_studies_documents` to create a context string from the documents of related studies. This context is used to provide examples in the CoT creation process.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Generating Messages for CoT**:\n",
    "  - We define a function `get_messages_for_create_CoT` that generates the system and user messages required for creating a CoT. These messages include the study title, description, and desired criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Prompt Creation**:\n",
    "  - We define a function `get_prompt_from_studies` that uses the above functions to generate the complete prompt for a given study. This prompt includes the context from related studies and the task instructions for generating the CoT.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Model Inference**:\n",
    "  - We load the HuggingFace model and tokenizer, and define a function `pipe` to generate the CoT using the model. The function takes the generated messages as input and returns the model's output.\n",
    "  - For Gemini, can use the function in the gemini section to generate the CoT.\n",
    "\n",
    "By following this workflow, we can systematically generate a Chain of Thought for clinical trial studies, leveraging the capabilities of HuggingFace's transformers and other relevant tools.\n",

Advances in the field of neuromodulation has led to development of an intentionally reversible percutaneous peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS) system that has had promising results when treating chronic postamputation pain. PNS may offer sustained pain relief even after the treatment period has ended. Currently, there is no convincing evidence regarding the role of PNS in the acute postoperative period, which may be a critical time to control pain as those with higher pain appear to be at higher risk for developing persistent post-procedural pain. The investigators of this study aim to evaluate the feasibility and effects of PNS in the acute postoperative period and determine the feasibility of completing a randomized controlled treatment outcome study.\\\\n\\\\nDetailed Description \\\\n16 patients with new nontraumatic transfemoral or transtibial amputation will be enrolled in the study\\\\n\\\\nHaving met inclusion criteria, the patients will be randomized to experimental or control groups\\\\n\\\\nPatients in the experimental group undergo placement of PNS leads within 7 days of amputation surgery\\\\n\\\\nPatients in both groups will be treated with standard pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic pain therapies and evaluated weekly for 8 weeks, then at 3, 6, and 12 months postamputation\\\\n\\\\n#Intervention \\\\n- DEVICE : Peripheral nerve stimulation \\\\n\\\\t- Up to 60 days of peripheral nerve stimulation\\\\n- OTHER : Standard Medical Therapy \\\\n\\\\t- Medications, physical therapy, or other pain treatments\", \"criteria\": \"#Eligibility Criteria:\\\\nInclusion Criteria:\\\\n\\\\n* Nontraumatic transfemoral (above-the-knee) or transtibial (below-the-knee) amputation\\\\n* Presence of postamputation pain rated at least 4 or more\\\\n\\\\nExclusion Criteria:\\\\n\\\\n* Beck Depression Inventory score greater than 20\\\\n* Systemic infection\\\\n* Immunocompromised or taking immunosuppressive medications\\\\n* Implanted electronic device\\\\n* Pregnancy\\\\n* Previous allergy to skin contact materials and/or anesthetic agent\\\\n* Altered mental status\\\\n* Inability to provide informed consent\\\\n##Sex :\\\\nALL\\\\n##Ages : \\\\n- Minimum Age : 18 Years\\\\n- Age Group (Child: birth-17, Adult: 18-64, Older Adult: 65+) : ADULT, OLDER_ADULT\\\\n\\\\n##Accepts Healthy Volunteers:\\\\n No\\\\n\"}'}, {'id': 'NCT01632709', 'distance': 114.42024230957031, 'document': '{\"metadata\": {\"NCT_ID\": \"NCT01632709\", \"Brief_Title\": \"Pathophysiology of Post Amputation Pain\", \"Official_title\": \"Pathophysiology of Post Amputation Pain\", \"Conditions\": [\"Amputation Stumps\", \"Neuroma\"], \"Interventions\": [\"Drug: Placebo\", \"Drug: Bupivacaine\"], \"Location_Countries\": [\"United States\"], \"Study_Design\": {\"Study_Type\": \"INTERVENTIONAL\", \"Phase\": [\"PHASE4\"], \"Primary_Purpose\": \"TREATMENT\", \"Allocation\": \"RANDOMIZED\", \"Interventional Model\": \"PARALLEL\", \"Masking\": \"SINGLE\"}}, \"description\": \"#Study Description \\\\nBrief Summary \\\\nThe purpose of this study is to see how Post Amputation Pain (PAP) affects the body and brain by using sensory testing (such as pinprick testing), taking pictures of your brain (using a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) machine) and biomedical interventions (such as an injection of pain medicine). All medicines and the fMRI machine used during this study are FDA approved. The investigators hope that by learning the causes of PAP, the investigators can help future amputees.\\\\n\\\\nDetailed Description \\\\nYour participation in this study will last for 5 weeks and you will be asked to come to a total of 3 visits. The first visit will be during the first week of the study, the second visit during the second week of the study and the third (final) visit will be during the fifth (and final) week of the study. For your first visit you will have a physical examination with some sensory stimulation tests (such as vibration and pinprick tests), some questionnaires about your health and pain history, hot and cold sensory tests, and we will take thermal pictures of your body before and after receiving a quick electrical stimulus. You will also be trained on how to use the finger-span device to rate your pain during the second visit, and how to use an electronic pain diary to record your pain scores three times a day during the five weeks of the study.\\\\n\\\\nThe second visit will begin with questionnaires from the first visit and thermal images with a quick electrical stimulus. You will then be brought to an fMRI scanner room at Northwestern University. For an hour and fifteen minutes we will take pictures of your brain and these pictures will help us understand the changes in your brain relating to pain. You will then be put into one of four treatment groups randomly.\\\\n\\\\nThe study treatment that you will get will be decided randomly or by chance, like flipping a coin. Injections in this study will use the local anesthetic bupivacaine (a long lasting drug like the numbing agent novocaine used by dentists). This drug causes numbness, blocks pain and other nerve function near the injection site for 6-8 hours. Group 1 will get a sympathetic nerve block of bupivacaine, which changes how your nerves transmit pain, in either the neck or lower back (depending on where the amputation is located), Group 2 will get a placebo injection (no active medicine) in either the neck or lower back (depending on where the amputation is located), Group 3 will get a neuroma injection of bupivacaine (a neuroma is a group of nerves at the end of your residual limb), and Group 4 will get a placebo injection (no active medicine) at the neuroma. Some people get the bupivacaine injection and some people get the placebo injection so that we can compare the groups and see if the bupivacaine brings more, less or the same pain relief as a placebo injection. We scan your brain before the injection so that we can see how your brain responds to pain. We also scan your brain after the injection so that we can see if your brain responds differently to pain after the injection has been done.\\\\n\\\\nYou will know the location of your injection before you receive the treatment (neck, lower back or neuroma on your affected limb), but you will not know if you are getting a pain medication injection or placebo injection. Only the study doctors will know this information, and it can be told to you in case of an emergency. After the injection, you will have a second hour of brain scanning. After the scanning, you will be asked to complete some questionnaires, sensory tests, hot and cold temperature testing and we will take thermal pictures of your body before and after a quick electrical stimulus.\\\\n\\\\nYour third visit will be four weeks after your second visit. For your third visit you will have the same questionnaires as during the first and second visits, sensory tests, hot and cold temperature testing and we will take thermal pictures of your body before and after a quick electrical stimulus.\\\\n\\\\n#Intervention \\\\n- DRUG : Bupivacaine \\\\n\\\\t- one injection of 10ml of .25%\\\\n- DRUG : Placebo \\\\n\\\\t- Dry needling\\\\n\\\\t- Other Names :\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t- Dry needling\", \"criteria\": \"#Eligibility Criteria:\\\\nInclusion Criteria:\\\\n\\\\n* At least 18 years\\\\n* Able to read and speak English and provide informed consent\\\\n* Single Amputation, upper or lower.\\\\n* Subject has chronic post amputation pain lasting longer than three months\\\\n* Subject has healed amputation wounds\\\\n* Pain must be >=3 on a scale of 0 <= age <= 10, 0 being no pain, 10 being the worse pain imaginable.\\\\n* If subjects pain is non-existent during fMRI scans, the subject needs to be willing to have their pain induced by targeting pain trigger points (for example, study\\'s postdoctoral fellow would massage certain regions of the affected limb to trigger PAP).\\\\n* Subject agrees to 1) Stop taking all aspirin seven days prior to their second visit (Bayer,Ecotrin,Alka Seltzer, etc.) 2) All inflammatory medications 48 hours prior to their second visit (Advil, Motrin, Indocin, Lodine , Ibuprofen, Aleve, Naproxen, etc. 3) Supplements such as Vitamin E and Fish Oil 48 hours prior to their second visit.\\\\n* Subject agrees to continue other prescribed medications.\\\\n* Subject is willing to have hypodermic needle injections and images taken of them (digital, thermal, and fMRI).\\\\n* Able to understand and comply with all data collection methodology including electronic diary.\\\\n* If female, is not pregnant and not currently attempting to conceive; if of childbearing potential, use of a highly effective method of birth control (as determined by Pl).\\\\n\\\\nExclusion Criteria:\\\\n\\\\n* Subject is allergic to Isovue 300 or amide-type local anesthetics such as bupivicaine, lidocaine, or mepivacaine.\\\\n* Subject has a diagnosis of bleeding diathesis or an immune compromise.\\\\n* Subject has pain that is more severe than their post amputation pain.\\\\n* Subject has a clinical diagnosis of fibromyalgia.\\\\n* Subject has metal shavings and or is frequently in an environment where there is metal work being done or significant amounts of metal shavings.\\\\n* Subject has ferrous metal implants, aneurism clips, bioelectric devices, and other implants which can be affected by the magnetic field of the MRI.\\\\n* Subject is claustrophobic.\\\\n* Subject weighs more than 300 pounds.\\\\n* Subject plans to start new pain treatments or therapies during the study (e.g. new pain medication, injections, PT, surgery).\\\\n##Sex :\\\\nALL\\\\n##Ages : \\\\n- Minimum Age : 18 Years\\\\n- Age Group (Child: birth-17, Adult: 18-64, Older Adult: 65+) : ADULT, OLDER_ADULT\\\\n\\\\n##Accepts Healthy Volunteers:\\\\n Yes\\\\n\"}'}, {'id': 'NCT00130962', 'distance': 115.23377990722656, 'document': '{\"metadata\": {\"NCT_ID\": \"NCT00130962\", \"Brief_Title\": \"ALGRX 4975 in the Treatment of Patients With Morton\\'s Neuroma\", \"Official_title\": \"A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trial of ALGRX 4975 in Subjects With Painful Intermetatarsal Neuroma\", \"Conditions\": [\"Neuroma\"], \"Location_Countries\": [\"United States\"], \"Study_Design\": {\"Study_Type\": \"INTERVENTIONAL\", \"Phase\": [\"PHASE2\"], \"Primary_Purpose\": \"TREATMENT\", \"Allocation\": \"RANDOMIZED\", \"Interventional Model\": \"PARALLEL\", \"Masking\": \"DOUBLE\"}}, \"description\": \"#Study Description \\\\nBrief Summary \\\\nSubjects will have painful primary or post-operative intermetatarsal neuroma.

Likewise, Residual Limb Pain (RLP), pain felt from the remaining portion of the amputated limb, is common among amputees. Neuromas are found in more than 90% of lower extremity amputations, of which 30-50% are pain-generating for the patient . And while surgical techniques reveal the commonly held belief that neuroma formation is one of the causal drivers behind RLP, there has been no study to demonstrate that the two events - namely the magnitude of neuroma formation and the magnitude of pain experienced by amputees - are correlated. If this correlation, or lack thereof, were elucidated with the use of ultrasonography, this would provide the preliminary data which could lead to further studies in neuroma minimization and/or proliferation.\\\\n\\\\nObjective: This study seeks to use ultrasonography (US) to quantify the degree to which neuroma size and the nature of surrounding tissue correlate with the experience of RLP in trans-femoral amputees.\\\\n\\\\nSetting and Subjects: This study will enroll 30 trans-femoral amputees, male and female, who are over the age of 18.
