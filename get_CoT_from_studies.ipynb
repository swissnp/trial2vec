Ankle pumping exercises, deep breathing exercises, isometric knee and hip circumference strengthening exercises, sitting by the bed, timed walking with a tolerable load on the prosthetic side will be recommended.\\n\\nThe number and frequency of exercises were gradually increased; isotonic knee and hip circumference strengthening exercises It will be added. After the drainage of the surgical wound is removed on the 2nd or 3rd day, the patients will be discharged on the 4th postoperative day.

Today, after KT application, which is widely used in orthopedics, especially in arthroscopic interventions, no negative effects have been observed on patients, and positive results have been reported, especially in the early period.

No tension will be applied while taping. The difference of the plaster from the kinesiotape is that it does not contain tension and does not allow stretching.\\n\\nKinesiotaping application; It will be done by a physical therapist who has a kinesiology taping course certificate.',\n",

To achieve this dual purpose, two elements are essential: access to the hip that best meets the musculature and is able to restore the balance, and adequate prosthesis. Despite the move towards a surgery less invasive hip replacement is a procedure that causes tissue damage. This results in nociceptive and neuropathic pain, which can become chronic in about 30% of cases.\\\\n\\\\nSeveral studies have shown that there are risk factors for chronic post-surgical pain. They are both related to patients but also to surgery. It is thus advantageous to reduce the postoperative pain, localized mainly in the trochanteric region, to decrease the risk of developing chronic post surgical pain. Now medical comunity know that the post-operative bruising and tissue damage are partly responsible for these pains.\\\\n\\\\nThe Kinesiotaping uses an adhesive elastic cotton tape color invented by Dr. Kase in the 1970s It is water resistant and retains its properties up to 5 days. It has the characteristic to cause elevation of the epidermis and thereby reduce the pressure on the mechanoreceptors below the dermis. This would have the effect of reducing nociceptive stimuli.\\\\n\\\\nIts designers also claim it would have a beneficial effect on the lymphatic and venous circulation. According Kase Kinesiotaping causes an uprising of the epidermis decreasing the pressure in the dermis and promoting lymphatic drainage through its mechanical action during movement.\\\\n\\\\nThe lymphatic system is responsible for the capture of waste from venous blood (catabolites, plasma proteins) and thus can promote the absorption of edema.\\\\n\\\\nIn his study, Donec highlights a significant decrease in pain and a higher absorption of postoperative edema in the Kin\\\\u00e9siotape\\\\u00ae group than in the control group in surgical patients with total knee arthroplasty .\\\\n\\\\nThe Curetape\\\\u00ae band is used in the orthopedic surgery department since 2010 in current care.\\\\n\\\\nConsequently, it seems interesting to evaluate the effect of Curetape\\\\u00ae in surgical patients with a total hip replacement.\", \"detailedDescription\": \"Main objectives / Secondary:\\\\n\\\\nTo evaluate the effect of the application of Kin\\\\u00e9siotape\\\\u00ae in patients undergoing a total hip replacement on pain and changes in the immediate postoperative edema.\\\\n\\\\nMethodology :\\\\n\\\\n* STUDY This will be a prospective randomized study in routine care, against placebo performed in the hospital group Paris Saint Joseph, 75014.\\\\n* Randomization:\\\\n\\\\nGiven the weakness of the literature on this subject Investigators opted for a trial randomization into 2 groups that will be made by the patient.

In the postoperative period, Paracetamol 10 mg/ml Infusion 3\\\\\\\\*1, 100 mg tramadol hydrochloride tablet 2\\\\\\\\*1 and celecoxib capsule 100 mg 2\\\\\\\\*1 will be routinely administered until the discharge period.\\\\n\\\\nConservative postoperative physiotherapy program:\\\\n\\\\nConservative exercise program will be started on the second day after the surgery. All patients will receive an exercise program combined with a 20-minute local cold application once a day. Ankle pumping exercises, deep breathing exercises, isometric knee and hip circumference strengthening exercises, sitting by the bed, timed walking with a tolerable load on the prosthetic side will be recommended.\\\\n\\\\nThe number and frequency of exercises were gradually increased; isotonic knee and hip circumference strengthening exercises It will be added. After the drainage of the surgical wound is removed on the 2nd or 3rd day, the patients will be discharged on the 4th postoperative day. All patients will be informed about the conditions and activities that need attention. Patients who continue their home exercise program after discharge will be called for control on the 10th day.\\\\n\\\\nKinesio taping: In addition to its use in regional pain syndromes in recent years, KT application has also been reported in the literature after various non-orthopedic surgical procedures . Today, after KT application, which is widely used in orthopedics, especially in arthroscopic interventions, no negative effects have been observed on patients, and positive results have been reported, especially in the early period. The investigators aimed to compare this treatment method, which has been shown to be effective in studies performed after total knee arthroplasty, with SHAM taping and conservative postoperative physiotherapy program control group in a prospective randomized comparison.\\\\n\\\\nKinesiotaping is applied to the sub-knee region in accordance with the lymphatic correction technique in order to reduce edema and pain from the first postoperative day in the group receiving KT treatment.Accordingly, the proximal part of the tape will be placed close to the lymph node.In our study, as stated in the literature, the proximal part of the tape will be adhered to the fibular head area next to the lymph nodes without applying any stretching.Then 5-10% stretching is applied and the distal part is adhered.\\\\n\\\\nThe strips are applied as 2 separate bands crossing each other (from the medial and lateral of the knee).The patients will be taped with kinesio tape on the first day and the third day postoperatively, and they will be discharged on the fourth day.\\\\n\\\\nAfter discharge, participant will be asked to remove the bands after 3 days as instructed.\\\\n\\\\nSHAM taping: Sham application will be taped with a plaster from the same area on the same days as the kinesio application. No tension will be applied while taping. The difference of the plaster from the kinesiotape is that it does not contain tension and does not allow stretching.\\\\n\\\\nKinesiotaping application; It will be done by a physical therapist who has a kinesiology taping course certificate.\"}, \"conditionsModule\": {\"conditions\": [\"Knee Arthroplasty\", \"Pain\", \"Edema\"], \"keywords\": [\"knee arthroplasty\", \"kinesiotaping\"]}, \"designModule\": {\"studyType\": \"INTERVENTIONAL\", \"phases\": [\"NA\"], \"designInfo\": {\"allocation\": \"RANDOMIZED\", \"interventionModel\": \"PARALLEL\", \"interventionModelDescription\": \"randomized controlled study\", \"primaryPurpose\": \"TREATMENT\", \"maskingInfo\": {\"masking\": \"DOUBLE\", \"maskingDescription\": \"This study was designed as blinded, randomized and controlled.the person who evaluates the patients before and after the treatment is blind.In other words,the person evaluating the patients and the person giving the treatment are different.\", \"whoMasked\": [\"PARTICIPANT\", \"OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR\"]}}, \"enrollmentInfo\": {\"count\": 187, \"type\": \"ACTUAL\"}}, \"armsInterventionsModule\": {\"armGroups\": [{\"label\": \"kinesiology group\", \"type\": \"EXPERIMENTAL\", \"description\": \"In the group receiving kinesiology treatment, kinesiotaping is applied to the sub-knee region in accordance with the lymphatic correction technique from the first postoperative day to reduce edema and pain.

To achieve this dual purpose, two elements are essential: access to the hip that best meets the musculature and is able to restore the balance, and adequate prosthesis. Despite the move towards a surgery less invasive hip replacement is a procedure that causes tissue damage. This results in nociceptive and neuropathic pain, which can become chronic in about 30% of cases.\\\\n\\\\nSeveral studies have shown that there are risk factors for chronic post-surgical pain. They are both related to patients but also to surgery. It is thus advantageous to reduce the postoperative pain, localized mainly in the trochanteric region, to decrease the risk of developing chronic post surgical pain. Now medical comunity know that the post-operative bruising and tissue damage are partly responsible for these pains.\\\\n\\\\nThe Kinesiotaping uses an adhesive elastic cotton tape color invented by Dr. Kase in the 1970s It is water resistant and retains its properties up to 5 days. It has the characteristic to cause elevation of the epidermis and thereby reduce the pressure on the mechanoreceptors below the dermis. This would have the effect of reducing nociceptive stimuli.\\\\n\\\\nIts designers also claim it would have a beneficial effect on the lymphatic and venous circulation. According Kase Kinesiotaping causes an uprising of the epidermis decreasing the pressure in the dermis and promoting lymphatic drainage through its mechanical action during movement.\\\\n\\\\nThe lymphatic system is responsible for the capture of waste from venous blood (catabolites, plasma proteins) and thus can promote the absorption of edema.\\\\n\\\\nIn his study, Donec highlights a significant decrease in pain and a higher absorption of postoperative edema in the Kin\\\\u00e9siotape\\\\u00ae group than in the control group in surgical patients with total knee arthroplasty .\\\\n\\\\nThe Curetape\\\\u00ae band is used in the orthopedic surgery department since 2010 in current care.\\\\n\\\\nConsequently, it seems interesting to evaluate the effect of Curetape\\\\u00ae in surgical patients with a total hip replacement.\", \"detailedDescription\": \"Main objectives / Secondary:\\\\n\\\\nTo evaluate the effect of the application of Kin\\\\u00e9siotape\\\\u00ae in patients undergoing a total hip replacement on pain and changes in the immediate postoperative edema.\\\\n\\\\nMethodology :\\\\n\\\\n* STUDY This will be a prospective randomized study in routine care, against placebo performed in the hospital group Paris Saint Joseph, 75014.\\\\n* Randomization:\\\\n\\\\nGiven the weakness of the literature on this subject Investigators opted for a trial randomization into 2 groups that will be made by the patient. The patient list will be balanced by randomly alternating blocks. the orthopedic ward staff and physiotherapists will not be informed of the first schedule to avoid a bias in the care of patients.

For all patients, postoperative rehabilitation program included early mobilization and physical therapy twice a day during the stay in orthopedic traumatology department. On the second day after surgery, lymphatic correction method was used on the Kinesio Taping® group patients and a standardized 30-minute MLD treatment was applied to the MLD group patients. Control group received only physiotherapy treatment. Circumference measurements were applied on preoperatively and the second, third, fourth day and 6th weeks after surgery. Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) was used to determine the functional outcomes on the 6th weeks after surgery.

A conservative postoperative physiotherapy program, which is routinely applied to all groups, will be applied. Thus, no patient will be left without treatment. The first group will be considered as the control group, which will be given only a conservative physiotherapy program.\\n\\nIn addition to the conservative postoperative physiotherapy program, the 2nd group will be taped without applying tension with a plaster and will be considered as the sham group.\\n\\nIn the third group, in addition to the conservative postoperative physiotherapy program, kinesiotaping for payment will be applied.\\n\\nIt is planned to prevent bias between the groups by giving standard analgesic treatment to all three groups in the postoperative period. In the postoperative period, Paracetamol 10 mg/ml Infusion 3\\\\*1, 100 mg tramadol hydrochloride tablet 2\\\\*1 and celecoxib capsule 100 mg 2\\\\*1 will be routinely administered until the discharge period.\\n\\nConservative postoperative physiotherapy program:\\n\\nConservative exercise program will be started on the second day after the surgery. All patients will receive an exercise program combined with a 20-minute local cold application once a day. Ankle pumping exercises, deep breathing exercises, isometric knee and hip circumference strengthening exercises, sitting by the bed, timed walking with a tolerable load on the prosthetic side will be recommended.\\n\\nThe number and frequency of exercises were gradually increased; isotonic knee and hip circumference strengthening exercises It will be added. After the drainage of the surgical wound is removed on the 2nd or 3rd day, the patients will be discharged on the 4th postoperative day. All patients will be informed about the conditions and activities that need attention. Patients who continue their home exercise program after discharge will be called for control on the 10th day.\\n\\nKinesio taping: In addition to its use in regional pain syndromes in recent years, KT application has also been reported in the literature after various non-orthopedic surgical procedures . Today, after KT application, which is widely used in orthopedics, especially in arthroscopic interventions, no negative effects have been observed on patients, and positive results have been reported, especially in the early period. The investigators aimed to compare this treatment method, which has been shown to be effective in studies performed after total knee arthroplasty, with SHAM taping and conservative postoperative physiotherapy program control group in a prospective randomized comparison.\\n\\nKinesiotaping is applied to the sub-knee region in accordance with the lymphatic correction technique in order to reduce edema and pain from the first postoperative day in the group receiving KT treatment.Accordingly, the proximal part of the tape will be placed close to the lymph node.In our study, as stated in the literature, the proximal part of the tape will be adhered to the fibular head area next to the lymph nodes without applying any stretching.Then 5-10% stretching is applied and the distal part is adhered.\\n\\nThe strips are applied as 2 separate bands crossing each other (from the medial and lateral of the knee).The patients will be taped with kinesio tape on the first day and the third day postoperatively, and they will be discharged on the fourth day.\\n\\nAfter discharge, participant will be asked to remove the bands after 3 days as instructed.\\n\\nSHAM taping: Sham application will be taped with a plaster from the same area on the same days as the kinesio application. No tension will be applied while taping. The difference of the plaster from the kinesiotape is that it does not contain tension and does not allow stretching.\\n\\nKinesiotaping application; It will be done by a physical therapist who has a kinesiology taping course certificate.\\nExample Criteria: Inclusion Criteria:\\n\\n1.

      "[\"**Step 1: Understanding the Importance of Reducing Anxiety and Fear in Childbirth**\\n\\nThe study aims to evaluate the effect of Emotional Freedom Technique (EFT) on reducing anxiety, fear of surgery, and traumatic birth perception in women undergoing cesarean section. This is crucial because anxiety and fear experienced before surgery can lead to uneasiness, restlessness, and dissatisfaction due to uncertainty (1). In the context of childbirth, anxiety and fear can play a significant role in the formation of traumatic perception towards birth (2).\\n\\n**Step 2: The Role of Midwives in Reducing Negative Feelings**\\n\\nMidwives play a vital role in providing care to pregnant women during the prenatal period, and their approach can significantly impact the woman's experience. A study by Öznur HAYAT ÖKTEM (3) highlights the importance of emotional support from healthcare professionals in reducing anxiety and fear during childbirth. Similarly, a study by Öznur HAYAT ÖKTEM (3) suggests that providing alternatives that allow women to make active decision-making can reduce pain, anxiety, and hormonal oscillations during labor.\\n\\n**Step 3: The Effectiveness of Non-Pharmacological Methods in Reducing Anxiety and Pain**\\n\\nNon-pharmacological methods, such as relaxation and breathing exercises, massage, positioning, and therapeutic communication, have been shown to be effective in reducing pain and anxiety during childbirth (4). A study by Öznur HAYAT ÖKTEM (3) suggests that providing non-pharmacological pain relief methods can lead to a positive birth experience. Similarly, a study by Öznur HAYAT ÖKTEM (3) found that utilizing non-pharmacologic and supportive methods to reduce labor pain is an important part of nursing/midwifery practices.\\n\\n**Step 4: The Importance of Emotional Support in Reducing Anxiety and Fear**\\n\\nEmotional support from healthcare professionals is essential in reducing anxiety and fear during childbirth. A study by Öznur HAYAT ÖKTEM (3) found that emotional support from healthcare professionals can lead to more successful and comfortable births, a complication-free birth, and less pain for both the woman and the baby. Similarly, a study by Öznur HAYAT ÖKTEM (3) suggests that providing emotional support can reduce the fear and anxiety experienced by pregnant women during labor.\\n\\n**Step 5: The Effectiveness of EFT in Reducing Anxiety and Fear**\\n\\nEFT is a method used to resolve emotional blockages in the energy body of the person. A study by Öznur HAYAT ÖKTEM (3) suggests that EFT may contribute to a decrease in post-traumatic stress disorder and to reduce the level of anxiety and fear. Considering the effectiveness of EFT in reducing anxiety and fear, it is reasonable to assume that it can also be effective in reducing anxiety, fear of surgery, and traumatic birth perception in women undergoing cesarean section.\\n\\n**Step 6: The Importance of Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria**\\n\\nTo ensure the validity and reliability of the study, it is essential to establish clear inclusion and exclusion criteria. The inclusion criteria should ensure that the participants are suitable for the study, while the exclusion criteria should exclude participants who may be at risk or may not benefit from the intervention. A study by Öznur HAYAT ÖKTEM (3) suggests that the inclusion criteria should include being at 38 weeks or more of pregnancy, having a single, healthy fetus in head position, and applying during the latent phase of labor. Similarly, a study by Öznur HAYAT ÖKTEM (3) suggests that the exclusion criteria should include having become pregnant through assisted reproductive techniques, having a gestational or chronic disease, and having an obstacle to giving birth vaginally.\\n\\n**Step 7: Conclusion**\\n\\nIn conclusion, the study aims to evaluate the effect of EFT on reducing anxiety, fear of surgery, and traumatic birth perception in women undergoing cesarean section. The study is based on the understanding that anxiety and fear experienced before surgery can lead to uneasiness, restlessness, and dissatisfaction due to uncertainty. The study also takes into account the importance of emotional support from healthcare professionals, the effectiveness of non-pharmacological methods in reducing anxiety and pain, and the effectiveness of EFT in reducing anxiety and fear. The inclusion and exclusion criteria are established to ensure the validity and reliability of the study.\\n\\nReferences:\\n\\n1. Öznur HAYAT ÖKTEM (3)\\n2. Öznur HAYAT ÖKTEM (3)\\n3.

The proposed work will extend this active study to enroll 100 new young adults (50% with bipolar disorder) to complete baseline clinical, MRI, and placebo-controlled alcohol administration sessions. The PI's K01 is focused on investigating differences in subjective and neural response to alcohol between bipolar disorder and typical developing young adults. The proposed study will focus on investigating changes in subjective response to alcohol, placebo response, and relations with neural trajectories, the role(s) of stress, and prediction of alcohol problems over a two-year period. Longitudinal follow-up (clinical, detailed assessment of alcohol use, and MRI) will occur on average 1- and 2-years following enrollment.

At 2-year follow-up, placebo-controlled alcohol administration sessions will be repeated to test if sensitivity to alcohol changes over time-and if change in sensitivity to alcohol is associated with progressive neural changes in corticolimbic brain networks during young adulthood-and associations with alcohol use and symptoms of AUDs over time, and interactions with bipolar disorder. Changes in placebo-response and if changes are predictive of increased alcohol use and symptoms of AUDs will also be modeled. At one-year follow-up, a subset of participants will be invited to complete a psychosocial stress and neutral fMRI task on separate days (counter balanced; n=40 per group).

Knowing who is at risk for alcohol abuse, and why, is crucial for the development of effective prevention and treatment strategies. Alcohol abuse has been traditionally considered a male-oriented problem and as a consequence research on risk factors specific to women has been minimal. However, the sex gap in substance abuse is closing rapidly, and findings from both animal and human studies suggest that females are actually more vulnerable to drug use than males. As such, there is an urgent need to identify sex differences in risk factors for alcohol abuse in order to develop sex-specific prevention and treatment efforts. One clear candidate risk factor is poor inhibitory control, both in terms of baseline levels of inhibition and sensitivity to the disinhibiting effects of alcohol. Recent studies suggest that sex hormones affect inhibitory control in drug-free individuals, potentially contributing to sex differences in baseline levels of inhibition. However, the degree to which fluctuations in sex hormones influence sex differences in inhibition-related brain function in sober and intoxicated individuals is not known. The proposed project will determine the neural and hormonal mechanisms underlying sex differences in sensitivity to the disinhibiting effects of alcohol in heavy drinkers.\\n\\nThe overall objective of the research is to identify hormonal determinants of alcohol effects on brain activation during response inhibition (BARI) in young adult female and male drinkers. BARI will be assessed using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during performance of the stop signal task. This task reliably activates right-lateralized prefrontal regions implicated in inhibitory control. This study will assess BARI during IV alcohol (60mg%) and saline infusion in women during the early follicular and mid-luteal phases and in men at matched intervals.\\nExample Criteria: Inclusion Criteria:\\n\\n* heavy drinking\\n* Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test score above 7\\n* right-handed\\n* BMI between 19 and 26\\n* high school education\\n* fluent in English\\n* women must have regular menstrual cycles\\n* not using hormonal contraceptives\\n\\nExclusion Criteria:\\n\\n* drug use disorder (SCID, DSM-5), other than nicotine or caffeine\\n* meets withdrawal criteria\\n* history of physical or psychiatric disease\\n* contraindication for fMRI\\n* pregnant or breastfeeding\\n* smoking more than 5 cigarettes per day\\n\\n</STUDY><STUDY>\\nExample Title: Sex Differences in Trauma, Inflammation and Brain Function and the Implications for Treatment Efficacy in Alcohol Use Disorder\\nExample Description: A twelve-week randomized placebo-controlled trial of naltrexone (NTX) will be conducted in one hundred people with alcohol use disorder (AUD), fifty of which will be women. Fifty healthy participants will serve as controls for baseline measures. We will use validated measures to comprehensively assess trauma exposure including: military sexual trauma (MST), physical or sexual assault, combat exposure, intimate partner violence, and other traumatic events. Emotion regulation will be assessed with the Cognitive Emotion Regulation questionnaire and Difficulty in Emotion Regulation scale. Functional magnetic resonance imaging at rest and during an emotion regulation task will assess limbic system connectivity and reactivity.

The study procedures involve functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scan(s), eight weeks of outpatient treatment, and a follow-up phase. During the fMRI session, all participants will engage in a well-validated sustained emotion provocation task, involving the viewing of stress, alcohol-cue, and neutral pictures, while concurrent collection of brain and stress hormone data takes place. Control participants will undergo a single fMRI session at baseline, whereas AUD participants will partake in two fMRI sessions before and after outpatient treatment.

      "['**Justification for Inclusion Criteria:**\\n\\n1. **Age Range (12-21 years)**: The study aims to assess the short and long-term consequences of alcohol exposure on brain, cognitive, and emotional/regulatory development during preadolescence and adolescence. This age range is crucial for understanding the effects of alcohol on brain development, as adolescence is a critical period of brain maturation (Giedd et al., 1999). Studies have shown that early alcohol exposure can lead to long-term changes in brain structure and function, particularly in regions involved in reward processing and impulse control (Squeglia et al., 2011; Squeglia et al., 2012).\\n\\n2. **Ability to Read and Understand English**: The study involves cognitive and emotional assessments, which require participants to understand and follow instructions. Ensuring that participants can read and understand English is essential for accurate data collection and interpretation. This criterion is also consistent with the inclusion criteria of other studies that involve cognitive and emotional assessments, such as the study on \"Neurobiological Factors Underlying Sex Differences in Risk for Alcohol Abuse\" (Example Study 3).\\n\\n3. **Availability for Follow-up**: The study involves multiple assessments over a period of time, including follow-up visits and daily monitoring using a smartphone app. Ensuring that participants are available for follow-up is crucial for collecting accurate and reliable data.

This criterion is consistent with the inclusion criteria of other studies that involve minors, such as the study on \"Neuroscience-Informed Treatment Development for Adolescent Alcohol Use\" (Example Study 1).\\n\\n5. **Consent for those 18-21 years**: For participants aged 18-21, obtaining consent is necessary to ensure that they are aware of the risks and benefits of the study and can provide informed consent. This criterion is consistent with the inclusion criteria of other studies that involve adults, such as the study on \"Biological Risk Factors for the Prospective Development of Alcohol Use Disorders in Young Adults With Bipolar Disorder and Typically Developing Young Adults\" (Example Study 2).\\n\\n**Justification for Exclusion Criteria:**\\n\\n1. **Weight > 300 lbs**: The study involves functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), which requires participants to lie still in the MRI machine. Excluding participants with a weight > 300 lbs is necessary to ensure that they can safely participate in the study and that the fMRI data can be accurately collected.\\n\\n2. **Braces or Unremovable Embedded Metal**: The study involves fMRI, which requires participants to be free from metal objects that can interfere with the MRI signal. Excluding participants with braces or unremovable embedded metal is necessary to ensure that the fMRI data can be accurately collected.\\n\\n3. **Claustrophobia or Inability to Lie Still in MRI Machine**: The study involves fMRI, which requires participants to lie still in the MRI machine for an extended period. Excluding participants with claustrophobia or an inability to lie still is necessary to ensure that they can safely participate in the study and that the fMRI data can be accurately collected.\\n\\n4. **Current or Past 12-mos Pregnancy (females)**: The study involves fMRI and other assessments that may not be safe for pregnant women.

Our findings highlight that individuals in the at-risk mental state (ARMS) category face cognitive, emotional, and sleep-related challenges, leading to compromised self-identity and impairments in daily functioning. A significant proportion of young adults at risk of mental health issues not only display cognitive vulnerabilities but also endure emotional instability and sleep disturbances, increasing the likelihood of suicidal ideation and persistent self-harming behaviors. It\\'s clear that individuals facing mental health challenges, especially those with ARMS, require support from the health system. Exercise has been linked to enhanced cognitive function and mental health. The mental health chatbot as a promising tool for adolescents and young adults in the ARMS, showing potential in alleviating anxiety, depression, and mental health risks. Additionally, cranial electrotherapy stimulation (CES) is recommended as a safe and effective approach to address sleep-related problems. Together, these interventions may be proposed as a comprehensive care strategy, providing secure support for individuals with ARMS.\\n\\nThe objective of this three-year study is to provide comprehensive care to young adults presenting with ARMS. The aim is use an exercise group (EGChat) developed by prior study and CES to decrease cognitive mental risks, improve emotional stability, enhance sleep quality, and elevate overall life satisfaction. A randomized controlled trial (RCT) design will be conducted using purposive sampling to recruit 180 young adults with ARMS from a medical center and its affiliated hospitals. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of three groups, undergoing a 16-week intervention: EGChat plus CES, EGChat without CES, or CES without EGChat groups. The study integrates the EGChat application into an online health promotion platform, coupled with CES intervention, to enhance the biological and psychological health of individuals at ARMS. The goal of this RCT study is to enhance the biological and psychological well-being of individuals with ARMS, covering exercise levels, Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) levels, health-promoting behaviors, metabolic indexes, cognitive mental risks, emotional status, sleep quality, and overall life quality. Assessments will occur at baseline (T0), 8 weeks into the intervention (T1), upon completion of the 16-week intervention (T2), and during a follow-up assessment at 3 months post-intervention (T3). The study will utilize generalized estimating equations (GEE) for mixed model repeated measures analysis to evaluate the significant influences of the intervention and interactions between study variables, utilizing group-time interaction. Additionally, a machine-learning framework for EGChat will be implemented to enhance outcome predictions. The analysis of these machine-learning algorithms will be conducted using the WEKA software.\\n\\nComprehensive care intervention programs for individuals with ARMS should address the management of cognitive mental risks, anxiety, depression, and insomnia. The study findings provide evidence supporting the effectiveness of EGChat and CES in assisting young adults with ARMS. The ultimate goals are to achieve early intervention, delay the onset of psychosis, impede disease progression, and enhance the patient\\'s capacity for self-management and societal adaptation.\\nExample Criteria: Inclusion Criteria:\\n\\n* between 18 and 65 years old\\n* meet the DSM-5 criteria for ARMS as assessed by psychiatrists, who serve as the Co-PI of this research\\n* exhibit persistent symptoms without clinically significant fluctuations\\n* consent to participate in the study and provide written informed consent.\\n\\nExclusion Criteria:\\n\\n* have a DSM-5 diagnosis of intellectual disability or substance (including alcohol) use disorder\\n* possess a history of epilepsy, head trauma, central nervous system diseases, or frequent syncope\\n* are pregnant or lactating\\n* have an implanted neurostimulator or cardiac pacemaker\\n* have metal implants in the body\\n* non-removable cochlear implant\\n* are unable to adhere to the protocol (including the absence of a computer, tablet, or smartphone for use)\\n\\n</STUDY><STUDY>\\nExample Title: Leveraging Biomarkers and New Technologies to Reduce Self-Injury and Substance Abuse Risk Among Highly Vulnerable Adolescents\\nExample Description: The overarching goals of the proposed project are threefold. AIM 1: Evaluate the clinical efficacy of tVNS in reducing NSSI and alcohol misuse among vulnerable adolescents. We hypothesize that self-administered tVNS, delivered in 25-minute sessions, will reduce self-reported NSSI and alcohol use, improve adolescents\\' self-reported emotion regulation, and yield improvements in sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system markers of emotion regulation and vulnerability to NSSI and alcohol misuse. AIM 2: Evaluate treatment adherence compared with traditional psychosocial interventions of similar duration. We hypothesize that adolescents will demonstrate greater treatment adherence than observed in traditional psychosocial interventions of similar duration, and rate tVNS as acceptable, unobtrusive, and favorable to face-to-face treatment. AIM 3: Evaluate maltreatment effects on tVNS. We hypothesize that tVNS will be effective for those with histories of maltreatment.\\n\\nAlthough rarely used to date among adolescents, tVNS alters neural and emotional responses to sad stimuli, and among adults, reduces suicide risk up to five years later. At present, it is being evaluated as a treatment for alcohol misuse in a NIH-funded clinical trial. This suggests potential for treating NSSI, alcohol misuse, post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS), and other disorders of emotion dysregulation. As outlined above, we will test the efficacy of tVNS in altering behavioral, emotional, and autonomic nervous system risk for NSSI and alcohol misuse, evaluate adherence and acceptability of tVNS among adolescents, and determine if maltreatment histories moderate treatment response.\\nExample Criteria: Inclusion Criteria:\\n\\n* Have used alcohol\\n* Have engaged in ≥ 3 episodes of NSSI in the past 6 months or ≥ 5 lifetime (1 of these 5 must be in the past year)\\n* Own a smartphone (iPhone or Android)\\n\\nExclusion Criteria:\\n\\n* Autism\\n* Schizophrenia\\n* Have a cardiac pacemaker, implanted defibrillator, or implanted or metallic electronic device\\n* Pregnant or breastfeeding\\n* Have a history of seizures or epilepsy\\n* Temperomandibular Joint Disorder\\n* Bell\\'s Palsy\\n* Impaired cranial nerve function or facial pain\\n\\n</STUDY><STUDY>\\nExample Title: Brief Intervention for Suicide Risk Reduction in High Risk Adolescents\\nExample Description: This 2-site R34 project developed a brief, flexible, manualized intervention with supporting phone app with the purpose of reducing the risk of suicidal behavior in adolescents with high suicidal ideation or a recent suicide attempt, during the transition from inpatient to outpatient care. This transition period is the highest risk period for attempted and completed suicide. Suicide is the 2nd leading cause of adolescent mortality, and there are currently no established interventions for suicidal teens. By developing a treatment that can be delivered on an inpatient unit prior to the transition to outpatient treatment, we anticipated being able to lower suicidal risk and increase the likelihood that participants will attend subsequent outpatient treatment. In keeping with the priorities of NIMH, this intervention aimed at reducing the risk of suicide and suicidal behavior was trans-diagnostic. We term the intervention ASAP, with anticipated components: (1) Adherence-promoting engagement and adherence to treatment through motivational interviewing; (2) Safety planning; and (3) Affect Protection- selecting from a menu of techniques for maintaining positive affect (e.g. savoring and switching strategies, mobilizing social support, engaging in emotion regulation and distress tolerance skills). Each of these components was delivered within a Motivational Interviewing framework for enhancing intrinsic motivation for change. Treatment was brief (3-5 hours), and flexibly delivered on inpatient units prior to initiation of outpatient treatment.\\n\\nASAP included the family in the treatment, and a safety plan phone app to extend the impact of treatment was also developed. Innovative features included: (1) delivery of an intervention at a time and place when suicidal risk is highest; (2) augmentation of protective factors against recurrent suicidal behavior, specifically by promoting development of positive affect, emotion regulation, distress tolerance, and social support; (3) a Safety plan phone app to extend the impact of treatment; and (4) liaison with the outpatient therapist to ensure continuity of care.\\n\\nThis project conducted an RCT of ASAP followed by Aftercare (AC) vs. AC alone to determine ASAP\\'s feasibility, acceptability, impact on proximal targets (e.g., adherence to outpatient care, sleep, positive affect, substance use), suicidal ideation and behavior. In total 68 suicidal adolescents were enrolled, 2 of whom were withdrawn following baseline assessment and were excluded from analyses, resulting in the final study sample size of 66. ASAP, developed with and intended for community clinicians, has the potential to be a sustainable intervention to reduce the burden of adolescent suicidality. Data analyses have been completed and results are being finalized.\\nExample Criteria: Inclusion Criteria:\\n\\n* Child participants will be adolescents (aged 12-17.11 years) admitted to an inpatient unit for a recent suicide attempt or significant suicidal ideation with a plan or intent.

Further increases have occurred since the COVID-19 pandemic began. Despite ambitious goals for reducing suicides and significant federal and private investment, suicide rates continue to rise unabated. To date, the predominant approach to mitigating suicide risk in the U.S. is secondary prevention. Typically, these programs identify risk of recurrence among those who have already attempted suicide at least once. Although secondary prevention is crucial, the majority of deaths by suicide occur on first attempt. Thus, targeted primary prevention earlier in development is essential. Most current primary prevention programs are intensive, expensive, and delivered by highly trained mental health providers, who are in short supply. Traditional face-to-face therapy is also unavailable to many who live in underserved communities, and disliked by adolescents, who much prefer digital delivery on their devices. This high-risk, high-reward proposal addresses these limitations and needs. We use an experimental therapeutics approach to evaluate the independent and combined efficacies of two unconventional but scalable interventions: transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation (tVNS) to target emotion dysregulation, and a peer-support smartphone app to combat social isolation. These low-cost interventions, which hold strong promise but have not been used before, can reach large numbers of adolescents, with much potential to reduce prospective suicide risk. We will enroll 212 adolescents, ages 13-17 years, who show elevations on at least two prominent risk factors for suicide (e.g., self-injury, maltreatment).\\n\\nUsing a 2 × 2 design, adolescents will be assigned randomly to receive 30 days of treatment with:\\n\\n1. tVNS to target emotion dysregulation,\\n2. a peer-support phone app to target social isolation,\\n3. tVNS + a peer-support phone app, or\\n4. enhanced treatment as usual with monitoring and access to resources.\\n\\nIntervention effects on mechanisms (emotion dysregulation, social isolation) proximal efficacy signals (e.g., physiological reactivity, self-harm) and target outcomes (suicidal ideation, suicidal behaviors) will be evaluated immediately post-intervention and at one-year follow-up. Treatment data will be monitored daily to fine-tune dosing of both interventions. This transformative and innovative proposal tests two novel, scalable preventive interventions designed to \"meet adolescents where they are\" by using digital technologies to address core mechanisms of suicide risk.\\nDesired criteria: Inclusion Criteria:\\n\\n* Aged between 13 and 17 years,\\n* Attend in person meetings in South Bend, IN or Rochester, NY. and,\\n\\nTwo of the following which will be scored during the phone screen:\\n\\n* Engaged in non-suicidal self-harm 3 times in the past 6 months or more than 5 times in their life time, with one occurrence in the past year.\\n* Show high scores on emotional dysregulation\\n* Show high scores on social isolation\\n* Show high scores on impulsivity\\n* Show high scores on depression\\n* Engage in alcohol or other substance use\\n\\nExclusion Criteria:\\n\\n* Parent reported autism or schizophrenia\\n* Implanted pacemaker or cardiac defibrillator, other implanted or metallic device\\n* Pregnant or breast feeding\\n* History of seizures or epilepsy\\n* TMJ Disorder\\n* Bells\\' Palsy\\n* Impaired cranial nerve function\\n* Facial Pain\\n\\nTask Instructions:\\n1.

      "[\"**Justification 1: Targeting High-Risk Adolescents**\\n\\nThe study aims to leverage noninvasive transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation (tVNS) and smartphone technology to reduce suicidal behaviors and suicide among highly vulnerable adolescents. This approach is justified by the increasing trend of suicide rates among adolescents, with a 35% increase over the past two decades in the U.S. (Leveraging Biomarkers and New Technologies to Reduce Self-Injury and Substance Abuse Risk Among Highly Vulnerable Adolescents). The study's focus on primary prevention is essential, as most deaths by suicide occur on the first attempt, and current primary prevention programs are often intensive, expensive, and delivered by highly trained mental health providers who are in short supply (Redesigning Mental Health Services to Reduce Adolescent Suicide).\\n\\n**Justification 2: Emotion Dysregulation and Social Isolation as Key Risk Factors**\\n\\nThe study targets emotion dysregulation and social isolation as key risk factors for suicide among adolescents. Emotion dysregulation is a well-established risk factor for suicidal behavior, and social isolation can exacerbate this risk (Brief Intervention for Suicide Risk Reduction in High Risk Adolescents). The use of tVNS to target emotion dysregulation and a peer-support phone app to combat social isolation is a novel and scalable approach that can reach large numbers of adolescents (Leveraging Biomarkers and New Technologies to Reduce Self-Injury and Substance Abuse Risk Among Highly Vulnerable Adolescents).\\n\\n**Justification 3: Importance of Early Intervention**\\n\\nThe study emphasizes the importance of early intervention in preventing suicidal behaviors and suicide among adolescents. Early intervention can help prevent the development of suicidal ideation and behaviors, and can also reduce the risk of recurrence (Reducing Suicide Risk in Adolescents and Young Adults Via a Psychobehavioral Intervention to Regularize Daily Rhythms and Improve Brain Circuitry Functioning). The use of digital technologies, such as smartphone apps, can facilitate early intervention and reach adolescents who may not have access to traditional face-to-face therapy (The Center for Enhancing Treatment & Utilization for Depression and Emergent Suicidality Phase 2-Study 3-BRITEPath).\\n\\n**Justification 4: Need for Novel and Scalable Interventions**\\n\\nThe study highlights the need for novel and scalable interventions that can reach large numbers of adolescents and address the core mechanisms of suicide risk. Traditional face-to-face therapy is often unavailable to many adolescents, particularly those in underserved communities, and may not be effective for those who prefer digital delivery (Leveraging Biomarkers and New Technologies to Reduce Self-Injury and Substance Abuse Risk Among Highly Vulnerable Adolescents). The use of tVNS and a peer-support phone app is a promising approach that can be delivered in a low-cost and accessible manner.\\n\\n**Justification 5: Importance of Monitoring and Fine-Tuning**\\n\\nThe study emphasizes the importance of monitoring and fine-tuning the interventions to ensure their effectiveness. Daily treatment data will be monitored to fine-tune the dosing of both interventions, which is a critical aspect of ensuring the interventions are effective and safe (Leveraging Biomarkers and New Technologies to Reduce Self-Injury and Substance Abuse Risk Among Highly Vulnerable Adolescents).\\n\\n**Inclusion Criteria:**\\n\\n* Aged between 13 and 17 years,\\n* Attend in person meetings in South Bend, IN or Rochester, NY. and,\\nTwo of the following which will be scored during the phone screen:\\n* Engaged in non-suicidal self-harm 3 times in the past 6 months or more than 5 times in their life time, with one occurrence in the past year.\\n* Show high scores on emotional dysregulation\\n* Show high scores on social isolation\\n* Show high scores on impulsivity\\n* Show high scores on depression\\n* Engage in alcohol or other substance use\\n\\n**Exclusion Criteria:**\\n\\n* Parent reported autism or schizophrenia\\n* Implanted pacemaker or cardiac defibrillator, other implanted or metallic device\\n* Pregnant or breast feeding\\n* History of seizures or epilepsy\\n* TMJ Disorder\\n* Bells' Palsy\\n* Impaired cranial nerve function\\n* Facial Pain\"]\n",

Accumulated data indicate that environmental factors, including diet, might play a key role in the pathogenesis and inflammation, through mechanisms involving gut dysbiosis, in genetically susceptible people. Epidemiological data suggest that a Mediterranean dietary pattern is associated with decreased risk for CD, whereas a Western diet, rich in animal fat, processed foods and food additives, seems to be linked with an increased disease risk.\\n\\nExclusive Enteral Nutrition (EEN) is the only well-established dietary therapy in CD and is used as the first line therapy for the induction of remission in mild to moderate pediatric CD. Evidence according to EEN efficacy in adults is not consistent, which could partly be explained by the compliance difficulty. It is of interest, that feacal inflammation increases rapidly after food re-introduction following EEN in children. Partial enteral nutrition (PEN) has been shown to be beneficial in maintaining remission, but poor compliance due to low formula palatability and patients\\' fatigue remains an important barrier in the clinical practice. Moreover, PEN is inferior to EEN in inducing remission. Crohn\\'s Disease Exclusion Diet (CDED), which eliminates specific dietary components hypothesized to induce dysbiosis, appears to be effective in inducing and maintaining remission both in pediatric and adult populations. In parallel, patients express a strong interest in ways to manage their disease through diet, so the establishment of a palatable and as flexible as possible dietary pattern, not merely for inducing remission, but also as a feasible maintenance strategy is one of the main priorities in CD research at present.\\n\\nTherefore, the aim of this study is to explore the effectiveness of the CDED and PEN in both inducing and maintaining remission of CD in adults. The investigators also wish to challenge patients with an early exposure to dairy products, to assess tolerability, prospecting for the development of a more flexible dietary approach based on the CDED principles. The investigators aim to assess the intervention effect on CD activity, based on routinely used clinical indices, blood and faecal inflammatory biomarkers (CRP, FC), health-related quality of life, nutritional status and dietary intake, in patients with mildly active CD.\\nExample Criteria: Inclusion Criteria:\\n\\n* Participants must have an established diagnosis of CD\\n* Participants must be in active disease, defined by either the confirmed inflammation at screening as CRP \\\\>5 mg/L, FC \\\\>200 mg/g, or presence of inflammation on endoscopy in the 3 months before screening based on retrospective review of procedure reports by the local investigator and the clinician\\'s assessment\\n* Individuals able to give informed consent and willingness to participate\\n\\nExclusion Criteria:\\n\\n* Age \\\\< 18 years old\\n* Previous extensive bowel resection\\n* Reported pregnancy or lactation\\n* Current stoma\\n* Current stenosis or abscess\\n* Clinically significant stricture\\n* Introduction of or change in dose of drug therapy within the past 8 weeks\\n* Comorbidities including diabetes or coeliac disease, or other concomitant serious comorbidity e.g. significant psychiatric, hepatic, renal, endocrine, respiratory, neurological, cardiovascular, neoplastic or other autoimmune disease\\n* Food allergies or intolerances, which do not permit participation in the study\\n* Any proven current infection such as positive stool cultures or positive tests for parasites or C. difficile.
