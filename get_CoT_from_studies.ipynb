    "## Chain of Thought (CoT) Creation\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we aim to create a Chain of Thought (CoT) for clinical trial studies using HuggingFace's transformers and other relevant libraries. Below is a step-by-step guide to our workflow:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Setup and Initialization**:\n",
    "  - We initialize the ChromaDB client and load the SentenceTransformer model for encoding queries.\n",
    "  - We define a function to fix invalid JSON strings, which is crucial for handling the metadata of clinical trial studies.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Retrieving Relevant Studies**:\n",
    "  - We define a function `retrieve_relevant_studies` that queries the ChromaDB collection to find studies relevant to a given query, excluding the study already present in the query.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Crafting Context from Studies**:\n",
    "  - We define a function `craft_context_from_studies_documents` to create a context string from the documents of related studies. This context is used to provide examples in the CoT creation process.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Generating Messages for CoT**:\n",
    "  - We define a function `get_messages_for_create_CoT` that generates the system and user messages required for creating a CoT. These messages include the study title, description, and desired criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Prompt Creation**:\n",
    "  - We define a function `get_prompt_from_studies` that uses the above functions to generate the complete prompt for a given study. This prompt includes the context from related studies and the task instructions for generating the CoT.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Model Inference**:\n",
    "  - We load the HuggingFace model and tokenizer, and define a function `pipe` to generate the CoT using the model. The function takes the generated messages as input and returns the model's output.\n",
    "  - For Gemini, can use the function in the gemini section to generate the CoT.\n",
    "\n",
    "By following this workflow, we can systematically generate a Chain of Thought for clinical trial studies, leveraging the capabilities of HuggingFace's transformers and other relevant tools.\n",

A conservative postoperative physiotherapy program, which is routinely applied to all groups, will be applied. Thus, no patient will be left without treatment. The first group will be considered as the control group, which will be given only a conservative physiotherapy program.\\\\n\\\\nIn addition to the conservative postoperative physiotherapy program, the 2nd group will be taped without applying tension with a plaster and will be considered as the sham group.\\\\n\\\\nIn the third group, in addition to the conservative postoperative physiotherapy program, kinesiotaping for payment will be applied.\\\\n\\\\nIt is planned to prevent bias between the groups by giving standard analgesic treatment to all three groups in the postoperative period. In the postoperative period, Paracetamol 10 mg/ml Infusion 3\\\\\\\\*1, 100 mg tramadol hydrochloride tablet 2\\\\\\\\*1 and celecoxib capsule 100 mg 2\\\\\\\\*1 will be routinely administered until the discharge period.\\\\n\\\\nConservative postoperative physiotherapy program:\\\\n\\\\nConservative exercise program will be started on the second day after the surgery. All patients will receive an exercise program combined with a 20-minute local cold application once a day. Ankle pumping exercises, deep breathing exercises, isometric knee and hip circumference strengthening exercises, sitting by the bed, timed walking with a tolerable load on the prosthetic side will be recommended.\\\\n\\\\nThe number and frequency of exercises were gradually increased; isotonic knee and hip circumference strengthening exercises It will be added. After the drainage of the surgical wound is removed on the 2nd or 3rd day, the patients will be discharged on the 4th postoperative day. All patients will be informed about the conditions and activities that need attention. Patients who continue their home exercise program after discharge will be called for control on the 10th day.\\\\n\\\\nKinesio taping: In addition to its use in regional pain syndromes in recent years, KT application has also been reported in the literature after various non-orthopedic surgical procedures . Today, after KT application, which is widely used in orthopedics, especially in arthroscopic interventions, no negative effects have been observed on patients, and positive results have been reported, especially in the early period. The investigators aimed to compare this treatment method, which has been shown to be effective in studies performed after total knee arthroplasty, with SHAM taping and conservative postoperative physiotherapy program control group in a prospective randomized comparison.\\\\n\\\\nKinesiotaping is applied to the sub-knee region in accordance with the lymphatic correction technique in order to reduce edema and pain from the first postoperative day in the group receiving KT treatment.Accordingly, the proximal part of the tape will be placed close to the lymph node.In our study, as stated in the literature, the proximal part of the tape will be adhered to the fibular head area next to the lymph nodes without applying any stretching.Then 5-10% stretching is applied and the distal part is adhered.\\\\n\\\\nThe strips are applied as 2 separate bands crossing each other (from the medial and lateral of the knee).The patients will be taped with kinesio tape on the first day and the third day postoperatively, and they will be discharged on the fourth day.\\\\n\\\\nAfter discharge, participant will be asked to remove the bands after 3 days as instructed.\\\\n\\\\nSHAM taping: Sham application will be taped with a plaster from the same area on the same days as the kinesio application. No tension will be applied while taping. The difference of the plaster from the kinesiotape is that it does not contain tension and does not allow stretching.\\\\n\\\\nKinesiotaping application; It will be done by a physical therapist who has a kinesiology taping course certificate.\\\\n\\\\n#Intervention \\\\n- OTHER : kinesio tape \\\\n\\\\t- According to this, the proximal part of the band is located close to the lymph node.
