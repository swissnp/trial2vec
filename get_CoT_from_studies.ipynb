Knee Replacement Surgery is most commonly performed in people with advanced osteoarthritis and should be considered when conservative treatments have been exhausted. Oncologic TKRs are different from the routine TKRs in a way that the former involves a wide local resection of the bone and soft tissues, ranging from 10 to 20 cm, resection of muscles like the head(s) of biceps femoris, the gastrocnemius muscle, the intermuscular septa, the joint capsule, etc. to ensure negative margins along with the complete resection of the tumour, followed by a reconstruction of almost the same length as that resected, to restore function.\\n\\nThe most common indication for doing oncologic TKR is Osteogenic Sarcoma (OGS) of and around the knee joint. The distal femur and proximal tibia are among the most common sites for primary bone tumor. OGS is the most common bone cancer in the world in children and adolescents, and the eighth-most common form of childhood cancer, accounting for 4% of all childhood cancers worldwide. In India, the incidence varies from 4.7% to 11.6%, where this malignancy is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Additional treatment involves chemotherapy which further delays the healing and recovery of the patient.\\n\\nSurgery is a known risk factor for development of Chronic Post Surgical Pain(CPSP) which as per the definition given by Macrae and Davies, is defined by\\n\\n* Pain developing after a surgical procedure.\\n* Pain of at least 2 months' duration.\\n* Other causes of pain excluded (e.g.- malignancy, infection, etc.).\\n* Pain continuing from a pre-existing pain problem excluded.\\n\\nCPSP is a well known risk factor in many surgeries like (but not exclusive of)-\\n\\n* Mastectomy (Incidence of chronic pain = 11-57%)\\n* Amputation (30-85%)\\n* Inguinal hernia(5-63%)\\n* Cholecystectomy (3-50%)\\n\\nCPSP develops after a surgical procedure or increases in intensity after the surgical procedure. Literature on TKR surgeries indicated for osteoarthritis, report that although many patients report a good outcome after their total knee replacement, at a time when recovery should have been achieved, about 10-34% of patients undergoing TKR for osteoarthritis report moderate to severe CPSP. In around 30% of patients with CPSP, the origin of CPSP might be neuropathic. Neuropathic pain is more severe and adversely affects the quality of life of patients. TKR on its own may cause neuropathic pain postoperatively due to local nerve damage, often to the infrapatellar branch of the saphenous nerve or due to local inflammation. Risk factors associated with the operation include increased duration of surgery and tourniquet time, revision surgery, TKA versus unicompartmental arthroplasty and intraoperative nerve damage. Oncologic TKRs are more extensive and include much morbid excisions, and consequently may be presumed to have a similar if not a greater incidence of CPSP. Some of the risk factors for CPSP include the following (but not exclusive of)-\\n\\n* Pain, moderate to severe, lasting more than 1 month\\n* Repeat surgery\\n* Younger age (adults)\\n* Surgical approach with risk of nerve damage\\n* Neurotoxic chemotherapy\\n\\nPreoperative pain is consistently found to be a predictor for persistent postsurgical pain, which might reflect an independent risk factor but could well be a manifestation of predisposing factors.\\n\\nTata Memorial Hospital, a tertiary cancer institute is a 629 bedded hospital and conducts approximately 6000 surgeries per year out of which approximately 100 TKRs are performed per year. Analgesia peri-operatively is provided by an epidural infusion of a combination of local anaesthetic and an opioid or intravenous opioids with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory analgesics and paracetamol as appropriate. Postoperatively, if inserted, epidural analgesia is continued for up to 3-4 days to help mobilization \\\\& physiotherapy. In the absence of an epidural, around the clock analgesics with or without an opioid administered by means of an Intravenous Patient Controlled Analgesia (IVPCA) device is instituted. These patients are visited by the acute pain service team to address pain issues for the first 3 postoperative days or sometimes longer.\\n\\nSTUDY DESIGN:- Prospective and Observational study\\n\\nMETHODS and MATERIALS:- After Institutional Review Board approval, adult patients scheduled for TKR surgeries will be enrolled into the study after obtaining their informed consent over a 24 month period. However, interim analyses of all cases who have completed the 6 month follow up as on 31st October, 2017 would be analyzed as part of the co- principle investigator's thesis. All consenting patients will be assessed for their pain preoperatively and for the first 3 post-operative days, and at 1, 4 and 6 months from the date of surgery. Pain scores will be assessed using the Numerical Rating Scale during the 3 days after surgery. Pain will be managed by the Acute Pain Service team as per the standard management protocols.\\n\\nThe Brief pain inventory (BPI), (short form with translations, obtained with permission from MD Anderson), which assesses the severity of pain and the impact of pain on daily functions will be administered to the patient in the language familiar to them, preoperatively, at 1, 4 and 6 months postoperatively. The BPI is a useful instrument to assess the severity of pain and impact of pain on daily functions in patients with pain from chronic diseases, conditions such as cancer, osteoarthritis and low back pain, or with pain from acute conditions such as postoperative pain. The short form comprises of nine questions related to the severity of pain, impact of pain on daily function, location of pain, pain medications and amount of pain relief in the past 24 hours or the past week. It has been widely used and validated in several languages the world over.\\n\\nThe Musculoskeletal Tumour Society Score (MSTS) evaluates the functional condition (impairment) after completed tumour treatment will be estimated at the end of 6 months from the date of surgery. It is calculated on the basis of a standardized physical examination by the physician. This clinical examination assesses six criteria and differs slightly between the upper and lower limb. For the lower limb, the components are pain, function, emotional acceptance of the treatment outcome, need for walking aids, walking and gait. For all criteria, the estimate is made from bad to very good with parallel awarding of points (0 to 5). There is thus a numerical value for each of the six criteria. These six values are added and divided by the maximum possible number of points (30). The percentage value is obtained by multiplying the calculated point value by 100.\\n\\nThe painDETECT questionnaire (PD-Q) is a quick, simple and reliable screening tool to identify the likelihood of a neuropathic pain component in patients with neuropathic pain. This questionnaire had been prepared by professionals and validated in various languages including Hindi and Marathi. Its sensitivity and specificity is higher than other screening questionnaires for neuropathic pain, including the Douleur Neuropathique 4 (DN4), Leeds Assessment of Neuropathic Symptoms and Signs (LANNS), and the Neuropathic Pain Questionnaire (NPQ) (Freynhagen et al 2006). The PD-Q has been used to identify neuropathic pain in patients with knee osteoarthritis (Ohtori et al 2012) and to identify sensory proﬁles in patients with diabetic neuropathy and postherpetic neuralgia (Baron et al 2009).This questionnaire will be administered tot he patients preoperatively , at 1, 4 and 6 months after surgery.\\n\\nDetails of postoperative chemotherapy and radiation will also be obtained from patient's notes and the electronic medical record. If the patient cannot follow up at the said intervals, the pain scores would be obtained telephonically and the BPI and PD-Q forms in prepaid envelopes would be given to them at discharge which they would have to duly fill in and post them to the given address at the appropriate intervals if they cannot visit the pain clinic. At the 6th month of follow up, they would be requested to visit the pain clinic for an assessment of MSTS score and completing the BPI and PD-Q.\\n\\nMEASUREMENTS:-\\n\\n* All demographic, preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative data would be collected by the investigators.\\n* Demographic data includes case no, age, sex, ASA (American Society of Anesthesiologists) grade.\\n* Preoperative variables include pain score, preoperative analgesics, duration of use, and the dose.\\n* Intraoperative variables include duration of surgery, tourniquet time, any nerve or muscle resection and length of bone resected.\\n* Postoperative variables include median average and worst pain score for the first 3 postoperative days , 1, 4 and 6 months after surgery.\\n* Analgesics administered postoperatively, dose \\\\& dosing intervals, impact on daily functions as obtained from the BPI pre-operatively, 1, 4 and 6 months postoperatively.\\n* The painDETECT score to identify the neuropathic component of pain if any, preoperatively and at 1, 4 and 6 months after surgery.\\n* The MSTS score calculated by the physician and obtained from the patient's record at the 6th month after surgery.\\n\\nSTATISTICAL ANALYSIS:- The above mentioned data will be presented as mean (sd), median (range), and frequency (percentage). Categorical data will be analyzed using the Chi-square test or Fisher Exact test (for binary data). Continuous variables will be analyzed using paired t test or Wilcoxon signed rank test as per distribution of data. Repeated measure ANOVA will be used for pain score analysis. Pearson correlation coefficients will be used for association. p-value \\\\<0.05 will be considered statistical significant.\\n\\nIntervention \\n- OTHER : Non interventional study \\n\\t- No intervention\",\n",

Likewise, Residual Limb Pain (RLP), pain felt from the remaining portion of the amputated limb, is common among amputees. Neuromas are found in more than 90% of lower extremity amputations, of which 30-50% are pain-generating for the patient . And while surgical techniques reveal the commonly held belief that neuroma formation is one of the causal drivers behind RLP, there has been no study to demonstrate that the two events - namely the magnitude of neuroma formation and the magnitude of pain experienced by amputees - are correlated. If this correlation, or lack thereof, were elucidated with the use of ultrasonography, this would provide the preliminary data which could lead to further studies in neuroma minimization and/or proliferation.\\n\\nObjective: This study seeks to use ultrasonography (US) to quantify the degree to which neuroma size and the nature of surrounding tissue correlate with the experience of RLP in trans-femoral amputees.\\n\\nSetting and Subjects: This study will enroll 30 trans-femoral amputees, male and female, who are over the age of 18.

All medicines and the fMRI machine used during this study are FDA approved. The investigators hope that by learning the causes of PAP, the investigators can help future amputees.\\n\\nDetailed Description \\nYour participation in this study will last for 5 weeks and you will be asked to come to a total of 3 visits. The first visit will be during the first week of the study, the second visit during the second week of the study and the third (final) visit will be during the fifth (and final) week of the study. For your first visit you will have a physical examination with some sensory stimulation tests (such as vibration and pinprick tests), some questionnaires about your health and pain history, hot and cold sensory tests, and we will take thermal pictures of your body before and after receiving a quick electrical stimulus. You will also be trained on how to use the finger-span device to rate your pain during the second visit, and how to use an electronic pain diary to record your pain scores three times a day during the five weeks of the study.\\n\\nThe second visit will begin with questionnaires from the first visit and thermal images with a quick electrical stimulus. You will then be brought to an fMRI scanner room at Northwestern University. For an hour and fifteen minutes we will take pictures of your brain and these pictures will help us understand the changes in your brain relating to pain. You will then be put into one of four treatment groups randomly.\\n\\nThe study treatment that you will get will be decided randomly or by chance, like flipping a coin. Injections in this study will use the local anesthetic bupivacaine (a long lasting drug like the numbing agent novocaine used by dentists). This drug causes numbness, blocks pain and other nerve function near the injection site for 6-8 hours. Group 1 will get a sympathetic nerve block of bupivacaine, which changes how your nerves transmit pain, in either the neck or lower back (depending on where the amputation is located), Group 2 will get a placebo injection (no active medicine) in either the neck or lower back (depending on where the amputation is located), Group 3 will get a neuroma injection of bupivacaine (a neuroma is a group of nerves at the end of your residual limb), and Group 4 will get a placebo injection (no active medicine) at the neuroma. Some people get the bupivacaine injection and some people get the placebo injection so that we can compare the groups and see if the bupivacaine brings more, less or the same pain relief as a placebo injection. We scan your brain before the injection so that we can see how your brain responds to pain. We also scan your brain after the injection so that we can see if your brain responds differently to pain after the injection has been done.\\n\\nYou will know the location of your injection before you receive the treatment (neck, lower back or neuroma on your affected limb), but you will not know if you are getting a pain medication injection or placebo injection. Only the study doctors will know this information, and it can be told to you in case of an emergency. After the injection, you will have a second hour of brain scanning. After the scanning, you will be asked to complete some questionnaires, sensory tests, hot and cold temperature testing and we will take thermal pictures of your body before and after a quick electrical stimulus.\\n\\nYour third visit will be four weeks after your second visit. For your third visit you will have the same questionnaires as during the first and second visits, sensory tests, hot and cold temperature testing and we will take thermal pictures of your body before and after a quick electrical stimulus.\\n\\nIntervention \\n- DRUG : Bupivacaine \\n\\t- one injection of 10ml of .25%, - DRUG : Placebo \\n\\t- Dry needling\\n\\t- Dry needling',\n",

Knee Replacement Surgery is most commonly performed in people with advanced osteoarthritis and should be considered when conservative treatments have been exhausted. Oncologic TKRs are different from the routine TKRs in a way that the former involves a wide local resection of the bone and soft tissues, ranging from 10 to 20 cm, resection of muscles like the head(s) of biceps femoris, the gastrocnemius muscle, the intermuscular septa, the joint capsule, etc. to ensure negative margins along with the complete resection of the tumour, followed by a reconstruction of almost the same length as that resected, to restore function.\\\\n\\\\nThe most common indication for doing oncologic TKR is Osteogenic Sarcoma (OGS) of and around the knee joint. The distal femur and proximal tibia are among the most common sites for primary bone tumor. OGS is the most common bone cancer in the world in children and adolescents, and the eighth-most common form of childhood cancer, accounting for 4% of all childhood cancers worldwide. In India, the incidence varies from 4.7% to 11.6%, where this malignancy is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Additional treatment involves chemotherapy which further delays the healing and recovery of the patient.\\\\n\\\\nSurgery is a known risk factor for development of Chronic Post Surgical Pain(CPSP) which as per the definition given by Macrae and Davies, is defined by\\\\n\\\\n* Pain developing after a surgical procedure.\\\\n* Pain of at least 2 months\\' duration.\\\\n* Other causes of pain excluded (e.g.- malignancy, infection, etc.).\\\\n* Pain continuing from a pre-existing pain problem excluded.\\\\n\\\\nCPSP is a well known risk factor in many surgeries like (but not exclusive of)-\\\\n\\\\n* Mastectomy (Incidence of chronic pain = 11-57%)\\\\n* Amputation (30-85%)\\\\n* Inguinal hernia(5-63%)\\\\n* Cholecystectomy (3-50%)\\\\n\\\\nCPSP develops after a surgical procedure or increases in intensity after the surgical procedure. Literature on TKR surgeries indicated for osteoarthritis, report that although many patients report a good outcome after their total knee replacement, at a time when recovery should have been achieved, about 10-34% of patients undergoing TKR for osteoarthritis report moderate to severe CPSP. In around 30% of patients with CPSP, the origin of CPSP might be neuropathic. Neuropathic pain is more severe and adversely affects the quality of life of patients. TKR on its own may cause neuropathic pain postoperatively due to local nerve damage, often to the infrapatellar branch of the saphenous nerve or due to local inflammation. Risk factors associated with the operation include increased duration of surgery and tourniquet time, revision surgery, TKA versus unicompartmental arthroplasty and intraoperative nerve damage. Oncologic TKRs are more extensive and include much morbid excisions, and consequently may be presumed to have a similar if not a greater incidence of CPSP. Some of the risk factors for CPSP include the following (but not exclusive of)-\\\\n\\\\n* Pain, moderate to severe, lasting more than 1 month\\\\n* Repeat surgery\\\\n* Younger age (adults)\\\\n* Surgical approach with risk of nerve damage\\\\n* Neurotoxic chemotherapy\\\\n\\\\nPreoperative pain is consistently found to be a predictor for persistent postsurgical pain, which might reflect an independent risk factor but could well be a manifestation of predisposing factors.\\\\n\\\\nTata Memorial Hospital, a tertiary cancer institute is a 629 bedded hospital and conducts approximately 6000 surgeries per year out of which approximately 100 TKRs are performed per year. Analgesia peri-operatively is provided by an epidural infusion of a combination of local anaesthetic and an opioid or intravenous opioids with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory analgesics and paracetamol as appropriate. Postoperatively, if inserted, epidural analgesia is continued for up to 3-4 days to help mobilization \\\\\\\\& physiotherapy. In the absence of an epidural, around the clock analgesics with or without an opioid administered by means of an Intravenous Patient Controlled Analgesia (IVPCA) device is instituted. These patients are visited by the acute pain service team to address pain issues for the first 3 postoperative days or sometimes longer.\\\\n\\\\nSTUDY DESIGN:- Prospective and Observational study\\\\n\\\\nMETHODS and MATERIALS:- After Institutional Review Board approval, adult patients scheduled for TKR surgeries will be enrolled into the study after obtaining their informed consent over a 24 month period. However, interim analyses of all cases who have completed the 6 month follow up as on 31st October, 2017 would be analyzed as part of the co- principle investigator\\'s thesis. All consenting patients will be assessed for their pain preoperatively and for the first 3 post-operative days, and at 1, 4 and 6 months from the date of surgery. Pain scores will be assessed using the Numerical Rating Scale during the 3 days after surgery. Pain will be managed by the Acute Pain Service team as per the standard management protocols.\\\\n\\\\nThe Brief pain inventory (BPI), (short form with translations, obtained with permission from MD Anderson), which assesses the severity of pain and the impact of pain on daily functions will be administered to the patient in the language familiar to them, preoperatively, at 1, 4 and 6 months postoperatively. The BPI is a useful instrument to assess the severity of pain and impact of pain on daily functions in patients with pain from chronic diseases, conditions such as cancer, osteoarthritis and low back pain, or with pain from acute conditions such as postoperative pain. The short form comprises of nine questions related to the severity of pain, impact of pain on daily function, location of pain, pain medications and amount of pain relief in the past 24 hours or the past week. It has been widely used and validated in several languages the world over.\\\\n\\\\nThe Musculoskeletal Tumour Society Score (MSTS) evaluates the functional condition (impairment) after completed tumour treatment will be estimated at the end of 6 months from the date of surgery. It is calculated on the basis of a standardized physical examination by the physician. This clinical examination assesses six criteria and differs slightly between the upper and lower limb. For the lower limb, the components are pain, function, emotional acceptance of the treatment outcome, need for walking aids, walking and gait. For all criteria, the estimate is made from bad to very good with parallel awarding of points (0 to 5). There is thus a numerical value for each of the six criteria. These six values are added and divided by the maximum possible number of points (30). The percentage value is obtained by multiplying the calculated point value by 100.\\\\n\\\\nThe painDETECT questionnaire (PD-Q) is a quick, simple and reliable screening tool to identify the likelihood of a neuropathic pain component in patients with neuropathic pain. This questionnaire had been prepared by professionals and validated in various languages including Hindi and Marathi. Its sensitivity and specificity is higher than other screening questionnaires for neuropathic pain, including the Douleur Neuropathique 4 (DN4), Leeds Assessment of Neuropathic Symptoms and Signs (LANNS), and the Neuropathic Pain Questionnaire (NPQ) (Freynhagen et al 2006). The PD-Q has been used to identify neuropathic pain in patients with knee osteoarthritis (Ohtori et al 2012) and to identify sensory pro\\\\ufb01les in patients with diabetic neuropathy and postherpetic neuralgia (Baron et al 2009).This questionnaire will be administered tot he patients preoperatively , at 1, 4 and 6 months after surgery.\\\\n\\\\nDetails of postoperative chemotherapy and radiation will also be obtained from patient\\'s notes and the electronic medical record. If the patient cannot follow up at the said intervals, the pain scores would be obtained telephonically and the BPI and PD-Q forms in prepaid envelopes would be given to them at discharge which they would have to duly fill in and post them to the given address at the appropriate intervals if they cannot visit the pain clinic. At the 6th month of follow up, they would be requested to visit the pain clinic for an assessment of MSTS score and completing the BPI and PD-Q.\\\\n\\\\nMEASUREMENTS:-\\\\n\\\\n* All demographic, preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative data would be collected by the investigators.\\\\n* Demographic data includes case no, age, sex, ASA (American Society of Anesthesiologists) grade.\\\\n* Preoperative variables include pain score, preoperative analgesics, duration of use, and the dose.\\\\n* Intraoperative variables include duration of surgery, tourniquet time, any nerve or muscle resection and length of bone resected.\\\\n* Postoperative variables include median average and worst pain score for the first 3 postoperative days , 1, 4 and 6 months after surgery.\\\\n* Analgesics administered postoperatively, dose \\\\\\\\& dosing intervals, impact on daily functions as obtained from the BPI pre-operatively, 1, 4 and 6 months postoperatively.\\\\n* The painDETECT score to identify the neuropathic component of pain if any, preoperatively and at 1, 4 and 6 months after surgery.\\\\n* The MSTS score calculated by the physician and obtained from the patient\\'s record at the 6th month after surgery.\\\\n\\\\nSTATISTICAL ANALYSIS:- The above mentioned data will be presented as mean (sd), median (range), and frequency (percentage). Categorical data will be analyzed using the Chi-square test or Fisher Exact test (for binary data). Continuous variables will be analyzed using paired t test or Wilcoxon signed rank test as per distribution of data. Repeated measure ANOVA will be used for pain score analysis.

Likewise, Residual Limb Pain (RLP), pain felt from the remaining portion of the amputated limb, is common among amputees. Neuromas are found in more than 90% of lower extremity amputations, of which 30-50% are pain-generating for the patient .

If this correlation, or lack thereof, were elucidated with the use of ultrasonography, this would provide the preliminary data which could lead to further studies in neuroma minimization and/or proliferation.\\\\n\\\\nObjective: This study seeks to use ultrasonography (US) to quantify the degree to which neuroma size and the nature of surrounding tissue correlate with the experience of RLP in trans-femoral amputees.\\\\n\\\\nSetting and Subjects: This study will enroll 30 trans-femoral amputees, male and female, who are over the age of 18.

All medicines and the fMRI machine used during this study are FDA approved. The investigators hope that by learning the causes of PAP, the investigators can help future amputees.\\\\n\\\\nDetailed Description \\\\nYour participation in this study will last for 5 weeks and you will be asked to come to a total of 3 visits. The first visit will be during the first week of the study, the second visit during the second week of the study and the third (final) visit will be during the fifth (and final) week of the study. For your first visit you will have a physical examination with some sensory stimulation tests (such as vibration and pinprick tests), some questionnaires about your health and pain history, hot and cold sensory tests, and we will take thermal pictures of your body before and after receiving a quick electrical stimulus. You will also be trained on how to use the finger-span device to rate your pain during the second visit, and how to use an electronic pain diary to record your pain scores three times a day during the five weeks of the study.\\\\n\\\\nThe second visit will begin with questionnaires from the first visit and thermal images with a quick electrical stimulus. You will then be brought to an fMRI scanner room at Northwestern University. For an hour and fifteen minutes we will take pictures of your brain and these pictures will help us understand the changes in your brain relating to pain. You will then be put into one of four treatment groups randomly.\\\\n\\\\nThe study treatment that you will get will be decided randomly or by chance, like flipping a coin. Injections in this study will use the local anesthetic bupivacaine (a long lasting drug like the numbing agent novocaine used by dentists). This drug causes numbness, blocks pain and other nerve function near the injection site for 6-8 hours. Group 1 will get a sympathetic nerve block of bupivacaine, which changes how your nerves transmit pain, in either the neck or lower back (depending on where the amputation is located), Group 2 will get a placebo injection (no active medicine) in either the neck or lower back (depending on where the amputation is located), Group 3 will get a neuroma injection of bupivacaine (a neuroma is a group of nerves at the end of your residual limb), and Group 4 will get a placebo injection (no active medicine) at the neuroma. Some people get the bupivacaine injection and some people get the placebo injection so that we can compare the groups and see if the bupivacaine brings more, less or the same pain relief as a placebo injection. We scan your brain before the injection so that we can see how your brain responds to pain. We also scan your brain after the injection so that we can see if your brain responds differently to pain after the injection has been done.\\\\n\\\\nYou will know the location of your injection before you receive the treatment (neck, lower back or neuroma on your affected limb), but you will not know if you are getting a pain medication injection or placebo injection.

Knee Replacement Surgery is most commonly performed in people with advanced osteoarthritis and should be considered when conservative treatments have been exhausted. Oncologic TKRs are different from the routine TKRs in a way that the former involves a wide local resection of the bone and soft tissues, ranging from 10 to 20 cm, resection of muscles like the head(s) of biceps femoris, the gastrocnemius muscle, the intermuscular septa, the joint capsule, etc. to ensure negative margins along with the complete resection of the tumour, followed by a reconstruction of almost the same length as that resected, to restore function.\\\\n\\\\nThe most common indication for doing oncologic TKR is Osteogenic Sarcoma (OGS) of and around the knee joint. The distal femur and proximal tibia are among the most common sites for primary bone tumor. OGS is the most common bone cancer in the world in children and adolescents, and the eighth-most common form of childhood cancer, accounting for 4% of all childhood cancers worldwide. In India, the incidence varies from 4.7% to 11.6%, where this malignancy is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Additional treatment involves chemotherapy which further delays the healing and recovery of the patient.\\\\n\\\\nSurgery is a known risk factor for development of Chronic Post Surgical Pain(CPSP) which as per the definition given by Macrae and Davies, is defined by\\\\n\\\\n* Pain developing after a surgical procedure.\\\\n* Pain of at least 2 months\\' duration.\\\\n* Other causes of pain excluded (e.g.- malignancy, infection, etc.).\\\\n* Pain continuing from a pre-existing pain problem excluded.\\\\n\\\\nCPSP is a well known risk factor in many surgeries like (but not exclusive of)-\\\\n\\\\n* Mastectomy (Incidence of chronic pain = 11-57%)\\\\n* Amputation (30-85%)\\\\n* Inguinal hernia(5-63%)\\\\n* Cholecystectomy (3-50%)\\\\n\\\\nCPSP develops after a surgical procedure or increases in intensity after the surgical procedure. Literature on TKR surgeries indicated for osteoarthritis, report that although many patients report a good outcome after their total knee replacement, at a time when recovery should have been achieved, about 10-34% of patients undergoing TKR for osteoarthritis report moderate to severe CPSP. In around 30% of patients with CPSP, the origin of CPSP might be neuropathic. Neuropathic pain is more severe and adversely affects the quality of life of patients. TKR on its own may cause neuropathic pain postoperatively due to local nerve damage, often to the infrapatellar branch of the saphenous nerve or due to local inflammation. Risk factors associated with the operation include increased duration of surgery and tourniquet time, revision surgery, TKA versus unicompartmental arthroplasty and intraoperative nerve damage. Oncologic TKRs are more extensive and include much morbid excisions, and consequently may be presumed to have a similar if not a greater incidence of CPSP. Some of the risk factors for CPSP include the following (but not exclusive of)-\\\\n\\\\n* Pain, moderate to severe, lasting more than 1 month\\\\n* Repeat surgery\\\\n* Younger age (adults)\\\\n* Surgical approach with risk of nerve damage\\\\n* Neurotoxic chemotherapy\\\\n\\\\nPreoperative pain is consistently found to be a predictor for persistent postsurgical pain, which might reflect an independent risk factor but could well be a manifestation of predisposing factors.\\\\n\\\\nTata Memorial Hospital, a tertiary cancer institute is a 629 bedded hospital and conducts approximately 6000 surgeries per year out of which approximately 100 TKRs are performed per year. Analgesia peri-operatively is provided by an epidural infusion of a combination of local anaesthetic and an opioid or intravenous opioids with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory analgesics and paracetamol as appropriate. Postoperatively, if inserted, epidural analgesia is continued for up to 3-4 days to help mobilization \\\\\\\\& physiotherapy. In the absence of an epidural, around the clock analgesics with or without an opioid administered by means of an Intravenous Patient Controlled Analgesia (IVPCA) device is instituted. These patients are visited by the acute pain service team to address pain issues for the first 3 postoperative days or sometimes longer.\\\\n\\\\nSTUDY DESIGN:- Prospective and Observational study\\\\n\\\\nMETHODS and MATERIALS:- After Institutional Review Board approval, adult patients scheduled for TKR surgeries will be enrolled into the study after obtaining their informed consent over a 24 month period. However, interim analyses of all cases who have completed the 6 month follow up as on 31st October, 2017 would be analyzed as part of the co- principle investigator\\'s thesis. All consenting patients will be assessed for their pain preoperatively and for the first 3 post-operative days, and at 1, 4 and 6 months from the date of surgery. Pain scores will be assessed using the Numerical Rating Scale during the 3 days after surgery. Pain will be managed by the Acute Pain Service team as per the standard management protocols.\\\\n\\\\nThe Brief pain inventory (BPI), (short form with translations, obtained with permission from MD Anderson), which assesses the severity of pain and the impact of pain on daily functions will be administered to the patient in the language familiar to them, preoperatively, at 1, 4 and 6 months postoperatively. The BPI is a useful instrument to assess the severity of pain and impact of pain on daily functions in patients with pain from chronic diseases, conditions such as cancer, osteoarthritis and low back pain, or with pain from acute conditions such as postoperative pain. The short form comprises of nine questions related to the severity of pain, impact of pain on daily function, location of pain, pain medications and amount of pain relief in the past 24 hours or the past week. It has been widely used and validated in several languages the world over.\\\\n\\\\nThe Musculoskeletal Tumour Society Score (MSTS) evaluates the functional condition (impairment) after completed tumour treatment will be estimated at the end of 6 months from the date of surgery. It is calculated on the basis of a standardized physical examination by the physician. This clinical examination assesses six criteria and differs slightly between the upper and lower limb. For the lower limb, the components are pain, function, emotional acceptance of the treatment outcome, need for walking aids, walking and gait. For all criteria, the estimate is made from bad to very good with parallel awarding of points (0 to 5). There is thus a numerical value for each of the six criteria. These six values are added and divided by the maximum possible number of points (30). The percentage value is obtained by multiplying the calculated point value by 100.\\\\n\\\\nThe painDETECT questionnaire (PD-Q) is a quick, simple and reliable screening tool to identify the likelihood of a neuropathic pain component in patients with neuropathic pain. This questionnaire had been prepared by professionals and validated in various languages including Hindi and Marathi. Its sensitivity and specificity is higher than other screening questionnaires for neuropathic pain, including the Douleur Neuropathique 4 (DN4), Leeds Assessment of Neuropathic Symptoms and Signs (LANNS), and the Neuropathic Pain Questionnaire (NPQ) (Freynhagen et al 2006). The PD-Q has been used to identify neuropathic pain in patients with knee osteoarthritis (Ohtori et al 2012) and to identify sensory pro\\\\ufb01les in patients with diabetic neuropathy and postherpetic neuralgia (Baron et al 2009).This questionnaire will be administered tot he patients preoperatively , at 1, 4 and 6 months after surgery.\\\\n\\\\nDetails of postoperative chemotherapy and radiation will also be obtained from patient\\'s notes and the electronic medical record. If the patient cannot follow up at the said intervals, the pain scores would be obtained telephonically and the BPI and PD-Q forms in prepaid envelopes would be given to them at discharge which they would have to duly fill in and post them to the given address at the appropriate intervals if they cannot visit the pain clinic. At the 6th month of follow up, they would be requested to visit the pain clinic for an assessment of MSTS score and completing the BPI and PD-Q.\\\\n\\\\nMEASUREMENTS:-\\\\n\\\\n* All demographic, preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative data would be collected by the investigators.\\\\n* Demographic data includes case no, age, sex, ASA (American Society of Anesthesiologists) grade.\\\\n* Preoperative variables include pain score, preoperative analgesics, duration of use, and the dose.\\\\n* Intraoperative variables include duration of surgery, tourniquet time, any nerve or muscle resection and length of bone resected.\\\\n* Postoperative variables include median average and worst pain score for the first 3 postoperative days , 1, 4 and 6 months after surgery.\\\\n* Analgesics administered postoperatively, dose \\\\\\\\& dosing intervals, impact on daily functions as obtained from the BPI pre-operatively, 1, 4 and 6 months postoperatively.\\\\n* The painDETECT score to identify the neuropathic component of pain if any, preoperatively and at 1, 4 and 6 months after surgery.\\\\n* The MSTS score calculated by the physician and obtained from the patient\\'s record at the 6th month after surgery.\\\\n\\\\nSTATISTICAL ANALYSIS:- The above mentioned data will be presented as mean (sd), median (range), and frequency (percentage). Categorical data will be analyzed using the Chi-square test or Fisher Exact test (for binary data). Continuous variables will be analyzed using paired t test or Wilcoxon signed rank test as per distribution of data. Repeated measure ANOVA will be used for pain score analysis.

Likewise, Residual Limb Pain (RLP), pain felt from the remaining portion of the amputated limb, is common among amputees. Neuromas are found in more than 90% of lower extremity amputations, of which 30-50% are pain-generating for the patient . And while surgical techniques reveal the commonly held belief that neuroma formation is one of the causal drivers behind RLP, there has been no study to demonstrate that the two events - namely the magnitude of neuroma formation and the magnitude of pain experienced by amputees - are correlated. If this correlation, or lack thereof, were elucidated with the use of ultrasonography, this would provide the preliminary data which could lead to further studies in neuroma minimization and/or proliferation.\\\\n\\\\nObjective: This study seeks to use ultrasonography (US) to quantify the degree to which neuroma size and the nature of surrounding tissue correlate with the experience of RLP in trans-femoral amputees.\\\\n\\\\nSetting and Subjects: This study will enroll 30 trans-femoral amputees, male and female, who are over the age of 18.

All medicines and the fMRI machine used during this study are FDA approved. The investigators hope that by learning the causes of PAP, the investigators can help future amputees.\\\\n\\\\nDetailed Description \\\\nYour participation in this study will last for 5 weeks and you will be asked to come to a total of 3 visits. The first visit will be during the first week of the study, the second visit during the second week of the study and the third (final) visit will be during the fifth (and final) week of the study. For your first visit you will have a physical examination with some sensory stimulation tests (such as vibration and pinprick tests), some questionnaires about your health and pain history, hot and cold sensory tests, and we will take thermal pictures of your body before and after receiving a quick electrical stimulus. You will also be trained on how to use the finger-span device to rate your pain during the second visit, and how to use an electronic pain diary to record your pain scores three times a day during the five weeks of the study.\\\\n\\\\nThe second visit will begin with questionnaires from the first visit and thermal images with a quick electrical stimulus. You will then be brought to an fMRI scanner room at Northwestern University. For an hour and fifteen minutes we will take pictures of your brain and these pictures will help us understand the changes in your brain relating to pain. You will then be put into one of four treatment groups randomly.\\\\n\\\\nThe study treatment that you will get will be decided randomly or by chance, like flipping a coin. Injections in this study will use the local anesthetic bupivacaine (a long lasting drug like the numbing agent novocaine used by dentists). This drug causes numbness, blocks pain and other nerve function near the injection site for 6-8 hours. Group 1 will get a sympathetic nerve block of bupivacaine, which changes how your nerves transmit pain, in either the neck or lower back (depending on where the amputation is located), Group 2 will get a placebo injection (no active medicine) in either the neck or lower back (depending on where the amputation is located), Group 3 will get a neuroma injection of bupivacaine (a neuroma is a group of nerves at the end of your residual limb), and Group 4 will get a placebo injection (no active medicine) at the neuroma. Some people get the bupivacaine injection and some people get the placebo injection so that we can compare the groups and see if the bupivacaine brings more, less or the same pain relief as a placebo injection. We scan your brain before the injection so that we can see how your brain responds to pain. We also scan your brain after the injection so that we can see if your brain responds differently to pain after the injection has been done.\\\\n\\\\nYou will know the location of your injection before you receive the treatment (neck, lower back or neuroma on your affected limb), but you will not know if you are getting a pain medication injection or placebo injection. Only the study doctors will know this information, and it can be told to you in case of an emergency. After the injection, you will have a second hour of brain scanning. After the scanning, you will be asked to complete some questionnaires, sensory tests, hot and cold temperature testing and we will take thermal pictures of your body before and after a quick electrical stimulus.\\\\n\\\\nYour third visit will be four weeks after your second visit. For your third visit you will have the same questionnaires as during the first and second visits, sensory tests, hot and cold temperature testing and we will take thermal pictures of your body before and after a quick electrical stimulus.\\\\n\\\\nIntervention \\\\n- DRUG : Bupivacaine \\\\n\\\\t- one injection of 10ml of .25%, - DRUG : Placebo \\\\n\\\\t- Dry needling\\\\n\\\\t- Dry needling\", \"criteria\": \"Inclusion Criteria:\\\\n\\\\n* At least 18 years\\\\n* Able to read and speak English and provide informed consent\\\\n* Single Amputation, upper or lower.\\\\n* Subject has chronic post amputation pain lasting longer than three months\\\\n* Subject has healed amputation wounds\\\\n* Pain must be >=3 on a scale of 0 <= age <= 10, 0 being no pain, 10 being the worse pain imaginable.\\\\n* If subjects pain is non-existent during fMRI scans, the subject needs to be willing to have their pain induced by targeting pain trigger points (for example, study\\'s postdoctoral fellow would massage certain regions of the affected limb to trigger PAP).\\\\n* Subject agrees to 1) Stop taking all aspirin seven days prior to their second visit (Bayer,Ecotrin,Alka Seltzer, etc.) 2) All inflammatory medications 48 hours prior to their second visit (Advil, Motrin, Indocin, Lodine , Ibuprofen, Aleve, Naproxen, etc. 3) Supplements such as Vitamin E and Fish Oil 48 hours prior to their second visit.\\\\n* Subject agrees to continue other prescribed medications.\\\\n* Subject is willing to have hypodermic needle injections and images taken of them (digital, thermal, and fMRI).\\\\n* Able to understand and comply with all data collection methodology including electronic diary.\\\\n* If female, is not pregnant and not currently attempting to conceive; if of childbearing potential, use of a highly effective method of birth control (as determined by Pl).\\\\n\\\\nExclusion Criteria:\\\\n\\\\n* Subject is allergic to Isovue 300 or amide-type local anesthetics such as bupivicaine, lidocaine, or mepivacaine.\\\\n* Subject has a diagnosis of bleeding diathesis or an immune compromise.\\\\n* Subject has pain that is more severe than their post amputation pain.\\\\n* Subject has a clinical diagnosis of fibromyalgia.\\\\n* Subject has metal shavings and or is frequently in an environment where there is metal work being done or significant amounts of metal shavings.\\\\n* Subject has ferrous metal implants, aneurism clips, bioelectric devices, and other implants which can be affected by the magnetic field of the MRI.\\\\n* Subject is claustrophobic.\\\\n* Subject weighs more than 300 pounds.\\\\n* Subject plans to start new pain treatments or therapies during the study (e.g. new pain medication, injections, PT, surgery).\\\\\"Sex\\\\\" : ALL\\\\n\\\\\"Ages\\\\\" : \\\\n- Minimum Age : 18 Years\\\\n\\\\nAccepts Healthy Volunteers: Yes\\\\n\"}'}, {'id': 'NCT02283957', 'distance': 122.37474060058594, 'document': '{\"metadata\": {\"NCT_ID\": \"NCT02283957\", \"Brief_Title\": \"A Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of CNTX-4975 in Subjects With Painful Intermetatarsal Neuroma (Morton\\'s Neuroma)\", \"Official_title\": \"A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Dose-Ranging Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of CNTX-4975 in Subjects With Painful Intermetatarsal Neuroma (Morton\\'s Neuroma)\", \"Conditions\": [\"Painful Intermetatarsal Neuroma (Morton\\'s Neuroma)\"], \"Interventions\": [\"Drug: CNTX-4975\", \"Other: Placebo\"], \"Location_Countries\": [\"United States\"], \"Study_Design\": {\"Study_Type\": \"INTERVENTIONAL\", \"Phase\": [\"PHASE2\"], \"Primary_Purpose\": \"TREATMENT\", \"Allocation\": \"RANDOMIZED\", \"Interventional Model\": \"PARALLEL\", \"Masking\": \"DOUBLE\"}}, \"description\": \"Study Description \\\\nBrief Summary \\\\nStudy 4975-MN-202 is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group, single-injection study in which subjects will be randomized to receive three doses of CNTX-4975 or placebo injected into the intermetatarsal space around a Morton\\'s neuroma.

The results reported in the TAX 323 and TAX 324 trials indicate that the TPF regimen (docetaxel, cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil) improves overall survival comparing with the PF regimen (cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil), and the TPF regimen is globally the most accepted induction regimen for the treatment of LAHNSCC.\\n\\nHowever, the TPF regimen has been associated with high toxicity rates, and patients frequently decline cisplatin during concurrent radiotherapy and require the use of infusion pumps and a central venous catheter.\\n\\nExtensive efforts are ongoing to identify alternative schemes that are less toxic than the TPF regimen but are as effective for LAHNSCC and safely allow the use of definitive concurrent treatment based on cisplatin and radiotherapy.\\n\\nDetailed Description \\nThis non-randomized phase II trial evaluated the safety, feasibility and response rates of concurrent therapy (cisplatin and radiotherapy) after three cycles of an IC regimen based on the combination of cisplatin plus paclitaxel without 5-fluorouracil (5FU) (thereby avoiding infusion pumps and a central venous catheter) in LAHNSCC patients with a high tumor burden.\\n\\nThe patients were stratified by tumor subsite (oropharynx and hypopharynx/larynx) and by tumor resectable status (resectable or irresectable advanced squamous cell).\\n\\nIntervention \\n- DRUG : Induction TP chemotherapy \\n\\t- 3 cycles of paclitaxel 175mg/m2 and cisplatin 80mg/m2 q3w.

A combination of lateral-opposed portals, anterior and lateral wedged fields was used to treat the primary tumor and the lymph nodes. The primary tumor, macroscopically affected lymph nodes and bilateral cervical plus supraclavicular lymph chains were treated with five fractions of 2Gy per week for 5 weeks (up to a total of 50Gy). Gross tumor volume was defined as the primary gross tumor or involved node, and this measure was based on clinical, radiological and endoscopic examinations. An additional margin of 1.0cm was added to the GTV to create the CTV. A boost of five fractions of 2Gy per week for 2 additional weeks (up to a total dose of 70Gy) was prescribed to the CTV plus a margin of 1.0cm.\\n\\t- Cisplatin, Radiotherapy, Concurrent chemoradiotherapy based on cisplatin\\nExample Criteria: Inclusion Criteria:\\n\\n* Histologically confirmed locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck (stage III and IV) eligible to chemoradiotherapy.\\n* Presence of measurable disease\\n* >= 18 year\\n* ECOG performance status: 0 <= age <= 2\\n* Adequate bone marrow functions evidenced by: absolute neutrophil count >= 1.5 x 109/L; platelet count >= 100 x 109/L and hemoglobin >= 90 g/L\\n* Adequate renal function.\\n* Adequate hepatic function.\\n* Patients or their legal representatives must be able to read, understand and provide written informed consent to participate in the study.\\n\\nExclusion Criteria:\\n\\n* Any previous chemotherapy or radiotherapy\\n* Patients who have known hypersensitivity to paclitaxel or cisplatin\\n* Patients who are receiving concurrent investigational, biological or immune therapies\\n* Concomitant administration of high doses of systemic corticosteroids\\n* Known HIV or Hepatitis B or C (active, previously treated or both; testing is not required)\\n* Uncontrolled CNS disease (e.g., seizures not controlled with standard medical therapy)\\n* Clinically significant cardiovascular disease.\"Sex\" : ALL\\n\"Ages\" : \\n- Minimum Age : 18 Years\\n- Maximum Age : 76 Years\\n\\nAccepts Healthy Volunteers: No\\n\\n\\n</STUDY><STUDY>\\nExample Title: Early Phase II Study of Weekly Paclitaxel (BMS-181339) in Patient With Advanced or Recurrent Head and Neck Cancer\\nExample Description: Study Description \\nBrief Summary \\nThe purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and the safety of paclitaxel given weekly in patients with advanced or recurrent head and neck cancer\\n\\nIntervention \\n- DRUG : Paclitaxel \\n\\t- Solution, IV, 100 mg/m², Weekly for 6 of 7 weeks, until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity became apparent\\n\\t- Taxol, BMS-181339\\nExample Criteria: Inclusion Criteria:\\n\\n* Patients with locally advanced head and neck cancer pretreated with surgery and/or radiotherapy and not suitable for further radical local treatment or patients with distant metastases who may have received no or one chemotherapy regimen\\n\\nExclusion Criteria:\\n\\n* Patients with serious, uncontrolled medical illness\"Sex\" : ALL\\n\"Ages\" : \\n- Minimum Age : 20 Years\\n- Maximum Age : 74 Years\\n\\nAccepts Healthy Volunteers: No\\n\\n\\n</STUDY><STUDY>\\nExample Title: Late Phase II Study of Weekly Paclitaxel (BMS-181339) in Patients With Advanced or Recurrent Head and Neck Cancer\\nExample Description: Study Description \\nBrief Summary \\nThe purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and the safety of paclitaxel given weekly in patients with advanced or recurrent head and neck cancer\\n\\nIntervention \\n- DRUG : Paclitaxel \\n\\t- Solution, IV, 100 mg/m2, weekly for 6 of 7 weeks, until evidence of disease progression or unacceptable side effects became apparent\\n\\t- Taxol, BMS-181339\\nExample Criteria: Inclusion Criteria:\\n\\n* Give written and voluntary informed consent.\\n* Patients with cytologically or histopathologically confirmed head and neck cancer (except for thyroid cancer)\\n* Patients with locally advanced head and neck cancer pretreated with surgery and/or radiotherapy (plus or minus one chemotherapy regimen) and not suitable for further radical local treatment or patients with distant metastases who may have received no or one chemotherapy regimen\\n* Patients must have measurable disease (lesion(s) with largest diameter of 10 mm or more)\\n* Patients with 4 weeks or longer interval from completion of previous therapy.

This is consistent with the inclusion criteria of the Phase II Study of Genexol-PM and Cisplatin as Induction Chemotherapy in Unresectable, Locally Advanced Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC), which included patients with locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma who had not received prior chemotherapy or radiation therapy.\\n\\nStep 5: Patients with a history of another malignancy, organ allografts, or pre-existing neuropathy greater than or equal to CTC grade 2 will be excluded from the study. This is consistent with the exclusion criteria of the Rollover Study of Weekly Paclitaxel (BMS-181339) in Patients With Head and Neck Cancer, which excluded patients with a history of another malignancy or pre-existing neuropathy.\\n\\nStep 6: The study will involve administering paclitaxel and cisplatin in a neoadjuvant setting, which is a common approach in the treatment of locally advanced head and neck cancer. This approach is supported by the results of the TAX 323 and TAX 324 trials, which demonstrated the efficacy of the TPF regimen in improving overall survival in patients with locally advanced head and neck cancer.\\n\\nStep 7: The study will involve patients aged 18 years or older, which is consistent with the age range of other studies, such as the Phase II Study of Weekly Paclitaxel (BMS-181339) in Patients With Advanced or Recurrent Head and Neck Cancer, which included patients aged 20-74 years.\\n\\nStep 8: The study will involve patients with a performance status of 0-2, which is consistent with the inclusion criteria of other studies, such as the Phase II Study of Genexol-PM and Cisplatin as Induction Chemotherapy in Unresectable, Locally Advanced Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC), which included patients with an ECOG performance status of 0 or 1.\\n\\nStep 9: The study will involve patients with adequate bone marrow functions, renal function, and hepatic function, which is consistent with the inclusion criteria of other studies, such as the Phase II Study of Weekly Paclitaxel (BMS-181339) in Patients With Advanced or Recurrent Head and Neck Cancer, which included patients with normal major organ functions.\\n\\nStep 10: The study will involve patients with a life expectancy of at least 2 months or more from study initiation, which is consistent with the inclusion criteria of other studies, such as the Phase II Study of Genexol-PM and Cisplatin as Induction Chemotherapy in Unresectable, Locally Advanced Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC), which included patients with an expected survival period of at least 2 months or more from study initiation.\\n\\n</STEP-BY-STEP-JUSTIFICATION>\\n<Criteria>\\nLocally advanced, Stage II-IV (except M1), head and neck cancer\\n> = 1 measurable lesion\\nnot been previously treated for head and neck cancer\\nhistory of another malignancy\\norgan allografts\\npre-exiting neuropathy > = CTC grade 2\\n</Criteria>']\n",

With regular use of immunotheraputic interventions, needle biospy has become more frequent and requires bigger samples for an increasing battery of tests. There has been no clear consensus on which biopsy needle yields the best biopsy sample. It is unclear if large 19g needle offers better yield than a 22 g needle. Although previous studies comparing 21, 22 and 19g needles have suggested that larger needles yield larger biopsy sizes, conflictng studies have shown that larger biopsies lead to bloodier samples with potentially smaller fragments of tissue, offering no improvement in diagnostic, yield, adequacy or sample size.\\n\\nThis study compares biopsy samples collected using 19g and 22g needles from patients of non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) scheduled to undergo endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) and transbroncial needle aspiration (TBNA).\\n\\nDetailed Description \\nPrimary Objective To compare the diagnostic yield of 22g and 19g EBUS transbronchial needle aspirate (TBNA)\\n\\nSecondary Objectives\\n\\n1.

Enlarged and/or positron emission tomography (PET) positive cervical/supraclavicular lymph nodes (CSLs) are ideal targets for a minimally invasive diagnosis of lung cancer through a percutaneous ultrasound-guided biopsy (US-NAB). However, the prevalence of metastatic involvement of CSLs in patients with advanced lung cancer was never specifically assessed. Furthermore, the possible association of malignant CSLs involvement with molecular status was never investigated, unlike what was done for several other metastatic sites.\\n\\nIntervention \\n- PROCEDURE : Needle or forceps biopsy of cervical and/or supraclavicular lymph nodes \\n\\t- Patients with evidence of enlarged and/or PET positive cervical and/or supraclavicular lymph nodes suspected of being metastasis from lung cancer will be submitted to the biopsy from this location.\\n\\t- Ultrasound guided biopsy, - PROCEDURE : Needle, forceps or surgical biopsy of any lesion other than cervical and/or supraclavicular lymph nodes \\n\\t- Patients without evidence of enlarged and/or PET positive cervical and/or supraclavicular lymph nodes will be submitted to the biopsy considered less invasive and effective based on imaging data and clinical health status.\\n\\t- Ultrasound guided biopsy, Forceps biopsy during bronchoscopy, Surgical biopsy\\nExample Criteria: Inclusion Criteria:\\n\\n* Age >18 years at the time of the procedure;\\n* Suspected advanced, treatment naïve non-squamous NSCLC ;\\n* Indication to biopsy for diagnosis and/or molecular profiling;\\n* Written informed consent to the study participation.\\n\\nExclusion Criteria:\\n\\n* Patients with known non-squamous NSCLC sent for re-biopsy after first or second line treatment;\\n* Inability to stop anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy before the procedure (except acetylsalicylic acid 100 mg/day);\\n* Platelet count <50.000 per μL;\\n* Inability or unwillingness to provide a written informed consent.\"Sex\" : ALL\\n\"Ages\" : \\n- Minimum Age : 18 Years\\n\\nAccepts Healthy Volunteers: No\\n\\n\\n</STUDY><STUDY>\\nExample Title: A Pilot Study Evaluating the Performance of 19-gauge Needles in Testing Molecular Markers in Samples Obtained Via Endobronchial Ultrasound Guided Needle Aspiration of Lymph Nodes in Patients With Lung Cancer\\nExample Description: Study Description \\nBrief Summary \\nThe purpose of this study is to test whether the 19-gauge needle can collect more tissue and get better sampling during a bronchoscopy procedure.\\n\\n\\nExample Criteria: Inclusion Criteria:\\n\\n* Subjects with known or suspected lung cancer with mediastinal adenopathy as defined by a mediastinal lymph node >0.5 cm in short axis on EBUS or any lymph node with uptake on FDG-PET scan that is higher than background PET activity.\\n* Participants must lack bleeding disorders\\n\\nExclusion Criteria:\\n\\n* Subjects who lack fitness for flexible bronchoscopy as determined by the physician performing the bronchoscopy before the procedure\\n* Subjects with suspected sarcoidosis, lymphoma, or metastatic cancer from other sites (i.e. those without a known or suspected lung primary)\\n* Subjects on anticoagulation (other than Aspirin) whom cannot have their anticoagulation held for the procedure due to other clinical reasons (i.e. recent cardiac stent placement).\"Sex\" : ALL\\n\"Ages\" : \\n- Minimum Age : 18 Years\\n\\nAccepts Healthy Volunteers: No\\n\\n\\n</STUDY><STUDY>\\nExample Title: Detection of Heterogeneity in Central Lung Cancer - Prospective Randomized Controlled Trial to Evaluate the Diagnostic Value of EBUS-TBNA and ctDNA Analysis Compared to Endobronchial Forceps Biopsy\\nExample Description: Study Description \\nBrief Summary \\nStudy participants will be selected from clinical routine patients with endobronchial infiltration of a central lung cancer and indication for bronchoscopic sampling.\\n\\nConsented patients will undergo bronchoscopy for tumor sampling applying two routine sampling methods during one single procedure (EBUS-TBNA and conventional forceps sampling).

The assay used to detect circulating levels of PD-L1 currently requires core biopsies, and is not approved to be used for specimens collected through a needle based cytological technique. Though endobronchial ultrasound guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) has markedly improved the manner in which patients are diagnosed and staged for lung cancer, alternative means of tissue collection may be mandatory to offer patients access to newer lines of therapy such as PD-L1 inhibition. EBUS-miniforceps biopsy may allow bronchoscopists to obtain core biopsy specimens through the technique of endobronchial ultrasound, so that more invasive approaches such as surgery may be avoided. Feasibility using this approach would indicate that all patients being staged with endobronchial ultrasound procedures would be candidates for PD-L1 testing and potential therapy.\\n\\nThis study is proposed to evaluate the feasibility of using endobronchial ultrasound guided miniforceps biopsy (EBUS-MFB) to acquire tissue that is adequate for PD-L1 testing. Feasibility in this study is defined as the ability to obtain adequate material during EBUS procedures to perform PD-L1 testing.\\n\\nIntervention \\n- DEVICE : CoreDx Pulmonary Mini-Forceps \\n\\t- Manufactured by Boston Scientific\\n\\t- Endobronchial ultrasound guided mini-forceps\\nExample Criteria: Inclusion Criteria:\\n\\n* Patients with central lung lesion 1cm in size or larger identified on chest CT with the intention to undergo bronchoscopic evaluation and biopsy.
